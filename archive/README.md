# Epic 1 Archive

**Archived Epic 1: LangGraph Experimental Architecture**

## Archive Structure

### epic-1-reference/ (HIGH VALUE - Salvage for Epic 2)
- **agents/**: 5-agent implementations (patterns to copy)
- **mcp-configs/**: MCP server configs and strategy mappings
- **direct-integrations/**: Graphiti, DSPy, Sentry, Postgres custom tools
- **test-scenarios/**: Real test cases with NO MOCKS policy
- **state-models/**: Pydantic V2 state models

### epic-1-experimental/ (LOW VALUE - Reference only)
- **mcp-bridge/**: Custom mapping_mcp_bridge.js (obsolete - Claude SDK has native MCP)
- **langgraph-core/**: LangGraph workflow implementations (replaced by upstream fork)
- **temp-scripts/**: One-off experiments and temporary scripts

### epic-1-docs/ (MEDIUM VALUE - Historical context)
- **stories/**: Epic 1 user stories (1.1-1.9)
- **architecture-backup/**: Old LangGraph architecture docs
- **completion-reports/**: Story completion summaries

## Epic 1 Summary

- **Duration**: Stories 1.1-1.8 completed
- **Architecture**: Custom MCP bridge + LangGraph StateGraph
- **Agents**: Orchestrator, Analyst, Knowledge, Developer, Validator
- **MCP Servers**: 11 validated (Serena, Context7, Graphiti, Obsidian, Filesystem, etc.)
- **Performance**: Baseline established (3-10x slower than Claude SDK native MCP)

## Why Archived

Epic 1's custom MCP bridge (mapping_mcp_bridge.js) became obsolete when we discovered Claude SDK has native MCP support with superior performance. However, the agent patterns, tool assignments, and test scenarios remain valuable for Epic 2.

## Usage for Epic 2

Reference `epic-1-reference/` when implementing Epic 2:
- Copy agent logic patterns
- Reuse MCP server configurations
- Adapt test scenarios
- Learn from completion reports
