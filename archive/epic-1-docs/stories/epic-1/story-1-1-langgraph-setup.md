## Technical Implementation Details

### Required Dependencies
```python
# requirements.txt additions
langgraph>=0.0.55
langsmith>=0.1.0
pydantic>=2.5.0
sqlite3  # built-in Python
```

### Core State Model
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from datetime import datetime

class WorkflowState(BaseModel):
    workflow_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique workflow identifier")
    current_agent: str = Field(..., description="Currently active agent")
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    plan: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    research_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    generated_content: Optional[str] = None
    validation_status: Optional[str] = None
    errors: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

### Basic Node Structure
```python
def planning_agent(state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    """Planning Agent node implementation"""
    state.current_agent = "planning"
    # Implementation details
    return state

def research_agent(state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    """Research Agent node implementation"""
    state.current_agent = "research"
    # Implementation details
    return state
```

## Infrastructure Verification

### IV1: LangGraph Nodes Execute Successfully
- Verify all 4 nodes can be invoked without errors
- Test state passing between consecutive nodes
- Confirm Pydantic validation works at each step

### IV2: Agent Handoffs Work Correctly
- Test Planning â†’ Research handoff with sample data
- Test Research â†’ Dev handoff with sample data
- Test Dev â†’ PM handoff with sample data
- Verify state filtering preserves required fields only

### IV3: LangSmith Tracing
- Confirm traces appear in LangSmith dashboard
- Verify execution flow visualization
- Test performance metric collection

```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test each Pydantic model validation
- Test individual node functions
- Test state transformation logic

### Integration Tests
- Test full workflow execution with mock data
- Test checkpoint save/restore functionality
- Test error handling and recovery

### Performance Tests

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: LangGraph version compatibility issues
**Mitigation**: Pin specific versions, test with minimal example first

**Risk**: LangSmith API rate limiting during development
**Mitigation**: Implement local trace buffering, use test project

**Risk**: State model becomes too complex for multi-agent coordination
**Mitigation**: Start with minimal required fields, expand incrementally

## Success Criteria

- 4-agent LangGraph system operational and traceable
- State management works reliably with Pydantic validation
- Checkpoint/restore functionality proven
- Foundation ready for manual BMAD planning integration (Story 1.2)
