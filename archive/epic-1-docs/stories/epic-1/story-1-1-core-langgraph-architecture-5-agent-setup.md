# Story 1.1: Core LangGraph Architecture & 5-Agent Setup

As a **multiagent system developer**,
I want **a LangGraph orchestration system with 5 specialized agent nodes**,
so that **we can establish the foundation for multiagent coding workflow execution**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **LangGraph Foundation**: Create StateGraph with 5 nodes (Orchestrator, Analyst, Knowledge, Developer, Validator)
2. **Pydantic State Management**: Implement Pydantic models for structured agent state passing
3. **Agent Handoffs**: Define clear edges between agents with specialized tool access
4. **Persistence Setup**: Configure LangGraph checkpointing for workflow recovery
5. **Observability**: Integrate LangSmith for comprehensive tracing and monitoring
6. **Bridge Architecture**: Establish Python-Node.js bridge for MCP-use integration

## Implementation Notes

- **Architecture Reference**: Follow Winston's complete backend architecture document
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+, LangGraph (latest), Pydantic models, LangSmith integration
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent node has distinct MCP tool assignments and responsibilities
- **Bridge Pattern**: Python-Node.js bridge enables hybrid MCP integration (direct + wrapped)

## Success Criteria

- All 5 agents instantiate successfully within LangGraph StateGraph
- Agent state transitions work correctly with Pydantic validation
- Checkpointing enables workflow recovery and debugging
- LangSmith provides complete workflow observability
- Bridge layer enables communication with MCP-use tools

## Dependencies

- Winston's backend architecture document (complete)
- Technology stack decisions from architecture
- Source tree structure for implementation organization

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETED** - TDD implementation successful with all tests passing

## Dev Agent Record

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create failing tests for 5-agent StateGraph (TDD RED phase)
- [x] Implement Pydantic state models with validation
- [x] Build LangGraph StateGraph with 5 specialized agent nodes
- [x] Create all 5 specialized agent classes (Orchestrator, Analyst, Knowledge, Developer, Validator)
- [x] Configure checkpointing and persistence with MemorySaver
- [x] Integrate LangSmith observability and tracing
- [x] Establish Python-Node.js MCP bridge architecture
- [x] Pass all 20 tests (TDD GREEN phase)

### Agent Model Used
- Developer: James (Full Stack Developer Agent)
- Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Debug Log References
- Initial test failures: 20/20 failing (RED phase confirmed)
- Pydantic V1 â†’ V2 migration for field validators
- CompiledStateGraph API corrections (get_graph(), dict results)
- Checkpointing configuration with thread_id requirement
- Final test results: 20/20 passing

### Completion Notes
- âœ… LangGraph StateGraph with 5 agent nodes operational
- âœ… All agent handoff patterns working correctly
- âœ… Checkpointing enables workflow recovery
- âœ… MCP bridge supports both direct and wrapped integrations
- âœ… Full TDD cycle completed (RED â†’ GREEN)
