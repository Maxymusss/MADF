nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No auth/payment/PII handling. Browser security controlled by Chrome DevTools Protocol. MCP stdio transport properly isolated.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Chrome DevTools tool loading <2s. Real browser automation workflow: 12.81s (acceptable for E2E). Session caching implemented for efficiency.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling in mcp_bridge. Try-catch blocks throughout. Real browser validation confirms reliability. 18/18 tests passing consistently.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. DeveloperAgent has 7 well-defined browser methods. Consistent error handling patterns. Good documentation.'
