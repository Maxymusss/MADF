  - severity: high

    description: 'Tests claim "NO MOCKS" but mcp_bridge.py methods (call_serena_tool, call_context7_tool, call_sequential_thinking_tool) return hardcoded mock data'

      - 'tests/test_story_1_2_real_analyst_agent.py:1-4'
    suggested_owner: dev
    recommendation: 'Replace mock implementations with actual MCP server calls OR clearly document as simulated implementation for Story 1.2 with real integration deferred to Story 1.4+'

  - severity: medium
    category: code_quality
    description: 'Token metrics are simulated (symbols * 100) rather than measuring actual token usage'
    refs:
      - 'src/agents/analyst_agent.py:106'
    suggested_owner: dev
    recommendation: 'Integrate actual token counting or document as estimated metric'

  - severity: low

    description: 'Unused imports: asyncio in mcp_bridge.py, os in analyst_agent.py'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Clarify testing strategy: Are mocks acceptable for Story 1.2 as foundation, with real integration in later stories?'
      refs: ['tests/test_story_1_2_real_analyst_agent.py', 'src/core/mcp_bridge.py']
      rationale: 'Story and testing conventions conflict. Need alignment on acceptable approach for this phase.'

  future:
    - action: 'Implement actual MCP server integration (Story 1.4+)'
      refs: ['src/core/mcp_bridge.py:203-363']
      rationale: 'Replace hardcoded mock responses with real MCP protocol calls'

    - action: 'Add retry logic and timeout handling for MCP calls'
      refs: ['src/core/mcp_bridge.py']
      rationale: 'Improve reliability for real network calls'

    - action: 'Integrate actual token counting if AC 6 requires precision'
      refs: ['src/agents/analyst_agent.py:106']
      rationale: 'Current simulation sufficient for relative comparison but not absolute measurement'

strengths:
  - 'Excellent test architecture and organization (27 tests, 5 task groups)'
  - 'Comprehensive requirements traceability (6/6 ACs covered)'
  - 'Strong testing conventions update with sample output requirement'
  - 'Clean code structure with good documentation'
  - 'Fast test execution (0.03s) enables rapid iteration'
  - 'Successfully archived old mock tests, establishing pattern for future stories'
  - 'Demo scripts provide clear usage examples'
