# DSPy - Programming Language Models

## Overview
DSPy is a framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It enables rapid development of modular AI systems with algorithms for optimizing prompts and model weights.

## Core Philosophy
Move from brittle prompt engineering to structured, programmable approaches for working with language models. DSPy allows you to teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs through compositional Python code.

## Installation
```bash
pip install dspy
# For latest version from main branch
pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.git
```

## Key Features

### 1. Declarative Programming
- Write compositional Python code instead of prompt strings
- Build modular AI systems that are portable across different language models
- Enable fast iteration on AI system development

### 2. Modules and Signatures
- **Modules**: Pre-built components like `Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, and `ReAct`
- **Signatures**: Define input/output behavior for AI components
- Structured approach to describing AI behavior

### 3. Optimizers
Automatically tune prompts and model weights using various techniques:

#### MIPROv2
- Synthesizes better instructions automatically
- Improves prompt quality through optimization

#### BootstrapFinetune
- Creates datasets to finetune model weights
- Enables model-specific optimization

#### GEPA
- Proposes improved natural language instructions
- Enhances prompt effectiveness

## Supported Use Cases
- **Simple Classifiers**: Basic text classification tasks
- **Sophisticated RAG Pipelines**: Complex retrieval-augmented generation systems
- **Agent Loops**: Interactive AI agent implementations
- **Complex AI Workflows**: Multi-step reasoning and decision-making systems

## Language Model Support
- **OpenAI**: GPT models integration
- **Anthropic**: Claude models support
- **Local Models**: Support for locally hosted models
- **Multiple Providers**: Portable across different LM providers

## Core Components

## Example Usage Pattern

### Basic Structure
```python
import dspy

# Define signature
class BasicQA(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factual answers."""
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")

# Create module
generate_answer = dspy.Predict(BasicQA)

# Use in pipeline
response = generate_answer(question="What is the capital of France?")
```

### With Optimization
```python
# Define training examples
trainset = [
    dspy.Example(question="What is...", answer="...").with_inputs('question'),
    # More examples...
]

# Configure optimizer
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=your_metric_function)

# Optimize the module
optimized_module = optimizer.compile(generate_answer, trainset=trainset)
```
