## Market View - IGBs

Benchmark bonds rallied up to 10bps in the past couple of weeks tracking the rally in US rates post weaker than expected data prints. Long-end bonds have continued to underperform belly due to weak investor demand and duration reduction by local asset managers and lifers in their discretionary schemes.

**Key Observations:**
- Very choppy price action with big intra-day swings in most trading sessions
- Better investor participation in SDL auctions recently at elevated levels
- Investors looking to lock in higher spreads
- August CPI print broadly in line with market expectation
- Market to take further cues from FOMC this week and H2 borrowing calendar next week

### Front End Strategy
**NDOIS (3m - 1y)** pricing terminal 5.30-5.35 provides attractive risk reward to run receivers into RBI policy.
- Expect fixing to remain 5 bps below policy ~5.45% due to lower CPI prints and tariff uncertainty
- GST should have 50 bps lower impact on CPI
- Like running steepeners in NDOIS (1y x 5y) in 2:1 ratio, overlaying with extra receivers in 1y

### OIS Pricing (with mibor at repo-5bps):
| Meeting Date | Current Market Pricing |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 10-Oct-25 | -5.0 bps |
| 7-Dec-25 | -7.0 bps |
| 8-Feb-26 | -7.0 bps |
| 8-Apr-26 | -5 bps |
| 8-Jun-26 | 3 bps |
| 8-Aug-26 | 7 bps |
| 10-Oct-26 | 8 bps |

## USDINR Analysis

### Market Movement
INR posted modest gains of ~0.3% tracking strength in regional peers driven by move lower in dollar. Progress in trade talks and conciliatory exchange of messages between Modi and Trump may prevent worsening of risk sentiments.

### Trade Data Highlights
- Merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $26.5bn in August from $27.4bn in July
- Mainly driven by lower oil imports
- Gold imports increased to $5.4bn (+12% mom s.a.)
- Likely aided by higher international prices and inventory build up before festive season

### Flow Outlook
- FPI outflow from equities continue but at reduced pace
- Expected inflows from upcoming IPOs:
  - **Tata Capital:** $2bn (Sep-Oct)
  - **Groww:** $1bn (Sep-Oct)
- Should improve flow picture

### Technical & Strategy View
Given neutral positioning and improved sentiments, possibility of move towards 87.50 amid RBI capping topside around 88.30. The pair may struggle to make decisive move lower as we expect RBI and usual demand flows to keep the pair rangebound between **87.50-88.30**.

**Trading Recommendation:**
- Like tactical short USDINR position on lower dollar view and improved trade sentiments
- Prefer to hold short USDINR for target of 87.50 on 1s NDF with stop above 88.40
- With stable FX view short term, expect marginal down move in front end points (up to 6m)
- O/N points remain anchored around 0.3 ppd (5.5% implied yield)

### NDS Strategy
**1y / 2y NDS attractive receive opportunity:**
- Near term risks to USDINR tilt lower
- Onshore front-end points have softened recently making rolldown on NDS attractive
- 70 bps on basis proven decent resistance with good flows from carry players
- Expect basis to edge lower by 10-15 bps
