### Session Recap

Another slow session in APAC where the curve has continued to grind flatter ahead of FOMC tonight.

**Key Market Moves:**
- **10s:** 0.6bps richer and 1 tick away from yesterday's intraday high, currently sitting at **4.02%**
- Recent curve flows marked by unwinds of steepeners (both tactical stop outs and profit takes on structural positions)
- Today: Net steepeners in **5s30s** and **2s10s** into the move from fast money accounts during session

**Supporting Factors:**
- Strong 20y auction out of Japan supports bull flattening
- Better paying of long end forwards cross market from account base today

### Fed Pricing
- **September:** Now fully priced with October at **43bps cumulatively**
- Continued interest for received exposure in September as hedge for 50 bps for the meeting
- Further flows have skewed bearish

### Spread Activity
- Spread flows slowed after incessant demand for front end through belly spreads from FM
- Bulk of issuance + corporate Tax Day now over
- **SOFR/FEDS** being bought from variety of accounts
- These flows + persistently flattening rate curve + leg higher in equities have kept spreads well supported across curve going into FOMC

### Notable Flows

Flows continue to be light ahead of high leverage FOMC – **only 600mm 10s traded as of 0600 GMT**

**Thematic flows include:**
- **Steepening** of 5s30s and 2s10s in new risk from tactical players
- **Receiving** of 5y5y cross market from RM, along with paying of long end forwards from FM
- **Receiving interest** in the belly of the curve from Gamma hedgers
- **RV:** Receiving of 2s5s10s in multiple structures, both in new risk and risk reduction

---

### Views and Outlook

Despite 25bps being all but certain, **Sep FOMC has the makings to be one of the higher vol events of the summer** in our view.

**Current Setup:**
- Full **70bps priced** in '25
- **10s close to significant psychological level of 4%**
- Stocks continuing to eclipse all time highs on dovish expectations

### Risk Scenarios

**Risks are two sided:**

**Modal Outcome:** Hawkish "sell the fact"

**Dovish Tail Scenario:** Led by:
- Aggressively dovish SEPs
- More than expected dissents to 50bps
- Powell bending the knee at the press conference

### Trading Strategy

**Belly positioning:** Continue to think that the belly has room to cheapen in both scenarios
- Look to add to **2s5s steepeners against 5bps**

**Curve strategy:** Maintain flattening bias in **10s30s** spread curve
