## Ahead of FOMC: Key Thoughts from Trading, Economics & Strategy

### What to Expect from the FOMC

**One-liner:** GIR + Trading at 2 more cuts median in 2025 from the SEP tonight; GIR at 2 more in 2026 to 3.375%, 1 cut in 2027, no change in 2028, and an unchanged longer-run rate of 3%.

Market places some weight on a 3-median for 2025 but, given there were 7 dots at 0 in June, 2 cuts median the most likely outcome. Initial market reaction to this outcome could be slightly hawkish, with modest local cheapening in the front end at 7pm BST / 2pm EST.

**GS Trading base-case:** Modest 4-5bps selloff if the median dot for 2025 stays at 2; while a shift to 3 dots should lead to a rally of 10bps.

### Key Market Implications

**Bias to fade any kneejerk USD-upside on 2-dot 2025 outcome:**
- Expect Powell to maintain dovish pivot from Jackson Hole in the Conference
- Market expects the ranks of the doves to grow, and that they will be steering policy going forward
- Asian currency managers + allocators focus more on the policy rate
- Fed's delivery can act as a catalyst for further USD weakness in the Region
- Lower implied vol post event should continue to support higher yielders in the EM space

**Pain trade:** Bear flattener in USD-Rates if Powell sounds more hawkish than at Jackson Hole by overplaying the "balanced" outlook. Highly unlikely given recent data trajectory.

### Scenarios

**Dovish surprise:** 50bp cut, 3x25bp dots for 2025, and/or harder commitment from Powell for sequential cuts for remainder of 2025. Could drive more pronounced USD weakness led by Asian low yielders, including JPY.

**50bp risks:** If labor-market data continues to deteriorate, in play for Oct or Dec. Risk that cyclical assets exhibit "what does the FED know that we do not" reaction.

## Economic Insights

### David Mericle (Chief US Economist)
"We expect the median dot to show just two cuts in total in 2025 to 3.875%, though by a narrow margin. Supporting the labor market has become the Fed's top priority and is very likely to lead to a 25bp rate cut this week."

**Expected Path:**
- Two more cuts in 2026 to 3.375%
- One cut in 2027 to 3.125%
- No change in 2028
- Unchanged longer-run rate of 3%

### Monthly Job Growth Analysis
"Monthly Job Growth Now Looks Much Weaker and Is Running Below the Breakeven Rate"

## FX Strategy - Michael Cahill

Initial market reaction could be slightly hawkish given expected 2025 split in dots. However, offsetting factors:
1. Markets expect more dovish participants will steer policy
2. Asian currencies likely need to take reins for significant Dollar depreciation in Q4
3. Currency managers in region focus particularly on policy rate

## Trading Views

### DM Rates - Brandon Brown (US Treasury Trading)
- 25bp cut widely expected
- SEP likely to be initial focus
- Most likely outcome: median stays at 2 cuts
- Market places some weight on 3 median
- 71bps of cuts priced through year-end
- Room for modest local cheapening in front end

### Jan Scheffel (Global Co-Head of Short Term Macro Trading)
- 26bps currently priced for September
- Market consensus skewed towards 2 dots for 2025
- Expects modest 4-5bps selloff if median dot stays at 2
- 10bps rally if shift to 3 dots
- Maintains flattening bias in 10s30s spread curve

### EMFX Trading - Alan Stewart
Two-way risks but overall asymmetry favoring core USD short position:
- **Hawkish risks:** SEP showing 2x25bp cuts vs ~70bp priced by market
- **Dovish surprise:** 50bp cut or 3x25bp SEP median dot
- **Currency implications:** Asian low yielders should benefit once static negative carry gets eroded

## Equities Perspective - Shawn Tuteja

Despite deteriorating labor data and aggressive Fed easing pricing, equities continue higher led by cyclical/speculative sectors.

**Key debate:** Does hawkish or dovish signaling really matter for equities? Growing debate whether:
1. Year-end equities chase expectations override near-term Fed signaling
2. Current data usually only happens when recession is imminent

**Personal view:** Likely walk away with both hawkish and dovish soundbites. Post-expiry Friday, equities could have moment of weakness into October payroll data.

---

**Current Market Pricing for Fed Meetings:**
- September: 26bps (near certainty)
- Remaining 2025: ~70bps total

**Terminal Rate Pricing:** Currently below 2.90%
