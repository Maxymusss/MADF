## Economics Analysis by Kai Wei Ang

BI lowered policy rate by 25bp, against expectations by majority surveyed by Bloomberg (including us). BI said decision was "directed towards pushing growth", and decision also reveals confidence over IDR stability, amid loosening of global financial conditions and with domestic markets holding up somewhat despite drastic changes in fiscal policy direction.

### Key Highlights:

**#1: GDP Growth Forecast** – No change from last month, which was at 5.1% (or slightly above the mid-point of 4.6-5.4% range). Finance Minister Purbaya did hint couple of days back that 3Q25 GDP may not be "good", and thus presumably softer vs. 2Q25 (5.12%) by our inference.

**#2: Current Account** – Expects current account to "remain narrow" in 3Q25, perhaps implying a better reading vs. 2Q25 (-0.8% of GDP).

**#3: IDR Characterized as "Stable"** – Presumably referencing against spot (USD-IDR largely within the 16,300-16,500 range the past month), rather than on a NEER basis. On the latter, our construct of IDR vs. 6 EM currencies (CNY, INR, KRW, PHP, THB, TWD) – as guided by policymakers in the past - is down by around 2% vs. the past month on a trade weighted basis and equal weighted basis.

**#4: Credit Growth** – Aug loan growth at 7.56% yoy vs. 7% in Jun, and marking a trend reversal, having declined since the start of this year. On a YTD basis, credit growth is at 8.8%, and the lower half of BI's full year target (8-11%).

**#5: Policy Response** – As with past months, BI talked up the need for stronger policy response to support growth, faster decline in lending rates, and to accelerate lending (especially to priority sectors).

**#6: Money Supply** – (First discussion on this for some time) seen higher on higher lending and "fiscal expansion". On the latter, we highlighted MOF is paying greater emphasis on disbursement, with Finance Minister today mentioning that agencies should ensure timely disbursement by end-Oct (else excess funds would be "taken away" and presumably reallocated elsewhere).

## Senior Rates Trading Analysis - Arya Adhy

Back to asymmetric corridor. FASBI is policy rate MINUS 100bps. Standing facility repo stays at policy rate PLUS 75 bps.

Pak Perry basically wants to press down the price of IDR money quicker --- he's losing patience with transmission.

### IDR NDS Run
| Tenor | Rate | Change |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1y | 4.793 / 4.753 | -15.65 bps |
| 2y | 4.870 / 4.830 | -16.00 bps |
| 3y | 5.045 / 5.005 | -16.00 bps |
| 4y | 5.205 / 5.165 | -16.00 bps |
| 5y | 5.355 / 5.315 | -15.00 bps |
| 7y | 5.515 / 5.475 | -15.00 bps |
| 10y | 5.665 / 5.625 | -15.00 bps |
