# Story 1.6: Error Tracking and Learning System Foundation

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.6
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 2, parallel development)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **comprehensive error tracking across all agents**,
so that **the system learns from mistakes and improves accuracy over time**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All agents, existing MADF analytics framework
- Technology: Error logging, analytics integration, existing tool usage tracking
- Follows pattern: Existing analytics directory structure and naming conventions
- Touch points: Analytics systems, learning system foundation, future ML integration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Each agent maintains detailed error logs with categorization and timestamping
2. Error tracking integrates with existing MADF analytics framework patterns
3. System tracks accuracy metrics for research validation and improvement
4. Error categorization supports future machine learning integration
5. Human feedback integration enables supervised learning capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Error tracking files follow existing analytics directory structure and naming conventions
7. Error logging integrates with existing tool usage analytics without data conflicts
8. Learning system foundation supports future Phase 2 ML enhancement integration

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Change is covered by appropriate tests
10. Documentation is updated for error tracking configuration
11. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing analytics framework with error tracking capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current tool usage analytics and analytics directory structure
- **Key Constraints:** Integration with existing analytics, future ML preparation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Error logging implemented for each agent with categorization and timestamping
