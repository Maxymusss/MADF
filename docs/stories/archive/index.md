## Risk Assessment

### **Resolved Risks** (via Technical Alignment)
- ‚úÖ **Data Source Complexity**: Simplified to free APIs
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Complexity**: Local-first approach
- ‚úÖ **Scale Premature Optimization**: Prototype-first focus

### **Monitored Risks**
- **mcp-use Integration**: HTTP bridge complexity managed with testing
- **LangGraph Learning**: Minimal workflow approach reduces complexity
- **API Rate Limits**: Caching and fallback sources implemented
- **Multi-language Coordination**: Clear interfaces and error handling

## Next Steps After Epic 1

### Phase 2: Sophistication Layer (4-5 weeks)
- Bloomberg Terminal API integration
- Advanced validation with ValidationAgent
- HITL dashboard for human oversight
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Production Features (ongoing)
- Quantitative analytics integration
- Enterprise monitoring and alerting
- Container deployment and scaling
- Machine learning optimization

## Implementation Notes

This Epic 1 implementation follows the corrected technical alignment established in `docs/prd/technical-alignment.md`, ensuring:

1. **Free news APIs** replace Bloomberg Terminal requirements
2. **Local development** approach instead of cloud deployment
3. **Prototype foundation** with incremental sophistication
4. **Single-user focus** with multi-user capabilities deferred to Phase 2

All stories include detailed acceptance criteria, technical specifications, and testing requirements to ensure successful 2-3 week delivery of the MVP foundation.
