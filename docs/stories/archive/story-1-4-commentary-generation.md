### Commentary File Format
```markdown
# Weekly Market Commentary - Week Ending Jan 27, 2025

## FX Markets
**EM Asia**: CNY strengthened 0.8% vs USD following PBOC's liquidity injection and improved manufacturing PMI. JPY declined 1.2% on BoJ dovish signals, while KRW gained 0.5% on export optimism. Regional currencies benefited from risk-on sentiment.

## Interest Rates
**US**: 10Y Treasury yields fell 8bp to 4.15% amid dovish Fed rhetoric and softer inflation expectations. **Asia**: JGB yields compressed following BoJ's yield curve control adjustments, while Chinese bonds rallied on policy easing expectations.

## Cross-Market Themes
Risk appetite improved across EM Asia as China's stimulus measures and US-China trade dialogue progress supported regional sentiment. Oil price stability (+2.1%) and tech sector resilience aided broader market confidence.

## Week Ahead
Key events: FOMC meeting (Wed), China PMI data (Fri), BoJ policy decision (Thu). Watch for US GDP revision impact on Fed expectations and any China policy announcements during Lunar New Year preparation.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test commentary generation with sample events
- Test word count validation and limits
- Test file output formatting
- Test PM agent quality validation

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflow from research to delivery
- Test error handling during content generation
- Test file delivery to hedgemonkey project
- Test multi-agent coordination

### Quality Tests
- Human review of generated commentary samples
- Validate geographic coverage completeness
- Test factual accuracy with known market events
- Verify professional tone and readability


## Testing Status ðŸ§ª

- [ ] **TESTED** - Testing pending
  - **Test Results**: TBD
  - **Unit Tests**: TBD
  - **Integration Tests**: TBD
  - **Test Date**: TBD

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and tested
- [ ] Commentary generation produces 50-80 word summaries
- [ ] File delivery to hedgemonkey project operational
- [ ] PM agent quality validation functional
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination proven end-to-end
- [ ] Ready for Story 1.5 (End-to-End Integration)

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Generated content lacks market insight or accuracy
**Mitigation**: Human review process, fact-checking against multiple sources

**Risk**: Word count limits too restrictive for meaningful analysis
**Mitigation**: Iterative refinement based on initial outputs, flexible limits

**Risk**: File delivery conflicts with existing hedgemonkey structure
**Mitigation**: Coordinate with hedgemonkey project requirements, test integration

## Success Criteria

- Weekly commentary generation operational
- Content meets quality and format standards
- File delivery integrates with hedgemonkey project
- Multi-agent workflow coordination proven
- Foundation ready for end-to-end integration testing (Story 1.5)
