# Story 1.7: Weekly Report Generation and Output

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.7
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 2, final integration)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **automated generation of comprehensive weekly market intelligence reports**,
so that **stakeholders receive timely, accurate Asia/G10 FX and interest rate analysis**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Product Manager agent (compilation), validated research outputs from all agents
- Technology: Report generation, existing MADF documentation structure
- Follows pattern: Existing documentation standards and `docs/` directory structure
- Touch points: System performance metrics, validation statistics, output formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. System generates weekly reports covering Asia/G10 currency movements and interest rate changes
2. Reports include validated research findings with source citations and confidence indicators
3. Output format supports both human consumption and potential API integration
4. Report generation handles incomplete data gracefully with clear gap identification
5. Reports include system performance metrics and validation statistics

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Report generation integrates with existing MADF documentation structure in `docs/` directory
7. Report output does not conflict with existing system outputs or analytics files
8. Generated reports maintain consistent formatting with existing MADF documentation standards

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Change is covered by appropriate tests
10. Documentation is updated for report generation configuration
11. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Build on Product Manager compilation workflow, integrate with docs structure
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** MADF documentation standards and directory structure
- **Key Constraints:** Report quality, incomplete data handling, format consistency

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Weekly report generation for Asia/G10 FX and interest rates implemented
- [ ] Reports include validated findings with source citations and confidence indicators
- [ ] Output format supports human consumption and potential API integration
- [ ] Graceful handling of incomplete data with gap identification functional
- [ ] System performance metrics and validation statistics included in reports
- [ ] Integration with existing MADF `docs/` directory structure verified
- [ ] No conflicts with existing system outputs or analytics files
- [ ] Consistent formatting with existing MADF documentation standards maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Report quality could be compromised by incomplete validation or data gaps
**Mitigation:** Clear gap identification, confidence indicators, graceful degradation for missing data
**Rollback:** Remove report generation, maintain manual compilation of agent outputs
