# Story 1.1: Product Manager Agent Foundation

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.1
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 16-20 hours (Day 1)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **a Product Manager agent that orchestrates task distribution and result compilation**,
so that **multiple research agents can work coordinately without manual intervention**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: MADF Node.js infrastructure, existing MCP configurations
- Technology: BMAD framework, Opus model, Node.js, JSON file-based communication
- Follows pattern: Existing `.claude/agents/` structure and MCP wrapper utilities
- Touch points: `.claude/` directory structure, MCP server configurations, analytics systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Product Manager agent uses BMAD framework with Opus model for complex orchestration decisions
2. Agent establishes JSON message format for task distribution to research agents
3. Agent compiles validated research outputs into weekly market intelligence reports
4. Agent maintains coordination logs for debugging and performance optimization
5. Agent handles research agent failures gracefully with retry mechanisms

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing MCP server configurations remain functional during Product Manager agent operation
7. File-based communication integrates with existing `.claude/` directory structure without conflicts
8. Agent startup/shutdown does not impact existing MADF tool analytics or essential tool loading

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Change is covered by appropriate tests
10. Documentation is updated for agent configuration and usage
11. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extends existing BMAD framework configuration with new PM agent persona
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow `.claude/agents/` structure and MCP wrapper patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing MCP infrastructure, 48-hour timeline

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Product Manager agent implemented using BMAD framework with Opus model
- [ ] JSON message format established for inter-agent communication
- [ ] Task distribution and result compilation functionality working
- [ ] Coordination logs implemented for debugging
- [ ] Failure handling and retry mechanisms functional
- [ ] Integration with existing `.claude/` structure verified
- [ ] No impact on existing MADF functionality confirmed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** BMAD framework integration complexity could exceed Day 1 timeline
**Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable PM agent, expand functionality iteratively
**Rollback:** Remove PM agent files, restore original BMAD configuration

## Dependencies

- None (Foundation story)

## Technical Dependencies

- BMAD framework configuration
- Opus model access
- Existing `.claude/` directory structure
- MCP infrastructure compatibility
