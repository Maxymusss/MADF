# Story 1.4: Validator Agent Cross-Reference System

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.4
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours (Day 2 afternoon)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **a validator agent using mcp-use library that fact-checks research outputs against authoritative sources**,
so that **final reports maintain high accuracy and credibility through automated cross-validation**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Research agents (Story 1.2), financial MCP servers (Story 1.3), Product Manager (Story 1.1)
- Technology: Python async, mcp-use library, LangChain Anthropic, Reuters/AP News MCP servers
- Follows pattern: Research agent implementation pattern from Story 1.2
- Touch points: JSON communication protocol, shared MCP server infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Validator agent uses mcp-use library with async Python implementation and LangChain Anthropic integration
2. Agent accesses Reuters/AP News through dedicated MCP server configurations via mcp-use multi-server setup
3. Agent cross-references research outputs using mcp-use tool calling against authoritative sources
4. Agent identifies conflicts between multiple research agent outputs with MCP server source attribution
5. Agent provides conflict resolution recommendations with confidence scoring and source citations
6. Agent flags timing inaccuracies and outdated information for correction using time-aware MCP queries
7. Agent integrates validation results into Product Manager compilation workflow through JSON messaging

**Integration Requirements:**
8. Validator agent mcp-use configuration shares financial MCP servers with research agents without conflicts
9. Validation results integrate seamlessly with existing file-based communication protocol
10. Agent async validation processes do not exceed established performance budgets or memory limits

**Quality Requirements:**
11. Change is covered by appropriate tests
12. Documentation is updated for validator agent configuration
13. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Similar to research agent but focused on cross-validation using authoritative sources
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Research agent implementation pattern (Story 1.2), JSON communication protocol
- **Key Constraints:** Performance limits, memory budget, authoritative source access

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Validator agent implemented with mcp-use library and LangChain Anthropic
- [ ] Reuters/AP News MCP server access functional
- [ ] Cross-reference capability against authoritative sources working
- [ ] Conflict identification with source attribution functional
- [ ] Conflict resolution recommendations with confidence scoring working
- [ ] Timing inaccuracy detection functional
- [ ] Integration with Product Manager workflow through JSON messaging working
- [ ] Shared MCP server configuration without conflicts verified
- [ ] File-based communication protocol integration seamless
- [ ] Performance and memory limits maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Complex validation logic could impact performance and timeline
**Mitigation:** Start with basic conflict detection, enhance validation logic iteratively
**Rollback:** Remove validator agent, maintain research agent outputs without cross-validation
