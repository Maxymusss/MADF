# Story 1.3: Financial Data Source MCP Server Configuration

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.3
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours (Day 2 morning, parallel with 1.2)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **dedicated MCP servers configured for financial data sources that integrate with mcp-use library**,
so that **research agents can access current market information through programmatic multi-server setup**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing MCP infrastructure, mcp-use research agents
- Technology: MCP servers (command/HTTP endpoints), mcp-use multi-server configuration
- Follows pattern: Existing `.mcp.json` configuration structure
- Touch points: Environment variables, API key management, dotenv integration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Financial MCP servers (Yahoo Finance, Google News, Reuters) configured with proper command/HTTP endpoints
2. mcp-use multi-server configuration enables simultaneous access to all financial data sources
3. MCP server configurations support both command-based and HTTP-based connections as needed
4. All MCP servers implement proper error handling compatible with mcp-use async operations
5. API key management integrates with existing dotenv environment setup and mcp-use configuration
6. MCP servers provide tools specifically optimized for Asia/G10 FX and interest rate data access

**Integration Requirements:**
7. Financial MCP servers operate independently from Claude Code MCP configurations
8. mcp-use multi-server configuration does not interfere with existing MADF MCP wrapper utilities
9. MCP server performance supports concurrent access from multiple Python agents without bottlenecks

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Change is covered by appropriate tests
11. Documentation is updated for MCP server setup and configuration
12. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Separate MCP server configurations for financial data sources
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing `.mcp.json` and dotenv patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Independent operation from Claude Code MCP setup, performance requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Yahoo Finance MCP server configured and functional
- [ ] Google News MCP server configured and functional
- [ ] Reuters MCP server configured and functional
- [ ] mcp-use multi-server configuration working
- [ ] Command and HTTP endpoint support verified
- [ ] Error handling compatible with mcp-use async operations
- [ ] API key management integrated with dotenv
- [ ] Asia/G10 FX and interest rate data access tools functional
- [ ] Independent operation from Claude Code MCP confirmed
- [ ] No interference with existing MCP wrapper utilities
- [ ] Performance supports concurrent access verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** MCP server resource contention and configuration conflicts
**Mitigation:** Use dedicated MCP server instances, careful configuration isolation
**Rollback:** Remove financial MCP server configurations, restore original setup
