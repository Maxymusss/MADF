# Story 1.5: Agent Coordination and Communication Protocol

**Epic:** Multi-Agent Financial Research Framework
**Story ID:** 1.5
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 2, parallel with other stories)

## User Story

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **a robust communication protocol between all agents**,
so that **the system operates reliably and can recover from failures**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All agents (Product Manager 1.1, Research 1.2, Validator 1.4)
- Technology: File-based JSON messaging, existing `.claude/` directory structure
- Follows pattern: Existing MADF file operations and analytics patterns
- Touch points: File system permissions, crash recovery, protocol scaling

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. File-based JSON messaging enables crash-resilient agent coordination
2. Message format supports task distribution, progress updates, and result aggregation
3. Protocol handles agent failures with automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
4. Communication logs provide debugging information for system optimization
5. Protocol scales to accommodate additional research agent variants

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Communication protocol files integrate with existing `.claude/` structure and permissions
7. File-based messaging does not interfere with existing MADF file operations
8. Protocol performance meets 48-hour implementation timeline requirements

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Change is covered by appropriate tests
10. Documentation is updated for communication protocol usage
11. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing `.claude/` directory structure with communication subdirectory
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** MADF file operations and analytics patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Crash resilience, scalability, performance requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] File-based JSON messaging protocol implemented
- [ ] Message format supports task distribution, progress updates, result aggregation
- [ ] Agent failure handling with retry and fallback mechanisms functional
- [ ] Communication logs for debugging implemented
- [ ] Protocol scalability for additional research agents verified
- [ ] Integration with existing `.claude/` structure confirmed
- [ ] No interference with existing MADF file operations verified
- [ ] Protocol performance meets timeline requirements
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** File-based communication bottlenecks could impact agent coordination performance
**Mitigation:** Lightweight JSON message design, async processing, performance monitoring
**Rollback:** Simplify to direct agent-to-agent communication, remove file-based protocol

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Product Manager Agent Foundation (primary coordinator)
- Foundational for: Stories 1.2, 1.4 (research and validator agents)

## Technical Dependencies

- Existing `.claude/` directory structure
- File system permissions
