# 13. Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Pydantic models validate all messages
- Rate Limiting: Built into MCP tool configurations
- API Key Security: Environment variables, never committed

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: API keys in environment variables only
- Session Management: Stateless agents, no sessions
- Credential Rotation: Manual rotation supported via env updates

## Performance Optimization

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <5 seconds per MCP tool query
- Message Processing: <1 second per message
- Caching Strategy: 5-15 minute TTL based on data type
- Concurrent Agents: Support 4 agents with <20% memory increase
