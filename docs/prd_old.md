### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ‚òëÔ∏è **New Framework Implementation** (Primary)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Multi-Agent Orchestration** (LangGraph state machine with 4 agents)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Tool Integration Architecture** (mcp-use for Bloomberg and financial data access)

**Enhancement Description:**
Implement a prototype-first multi-agent development platform using a 4-layer architecture: Claude Code for user interface, BMAD for strategic planning, LangGraph for multi-agent execution, and mcp-use for tool integration. The system starts with simplified implementations (Pydantic state models, manual BMAD chat, HTTP bridge tool access) and evolves incrementally to sophisticated features (validation automation, HITL dashboards, advanced error handling). This approach enables rapid value delivery while establishing the foundation for production-grade capabilities.

**Core Innovation - Prototype-First Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- LangGraph state machine orchestrates 4 specialized agents with clear handoffs
- BMAD planning layer generates structured workflows through human-agent collaboration
- mcp-use tool layer provides secure, multi-server access to Bloomberg and financial data
- Incremental sophistication: Start simple, add schemas/automation/validation as proven valuable
- Claude Code integration maintains familiar user experience

**Three-Phase Evolution:**
- Phase 1: Prototype Foundation (2-3 weeks). Basic LangGraph with 4 agents, manual BMAD planning, direct mcp-use integration
- Phase 2: Sophistication Layer (4-5 weeks). Add schemas, automated validation, HITL dashboards, error handling
- Phase 3: Production Features (ongoing). Advanced analytics, application generation, deployment automation

**Bloomberg Integration Strategy:**
- Real Bloomberg Terminal API (localhost:8194) via mcp-use client for production accuracy
- Mock Bloomberg service for development environment testing
- Asia/G10 FX pairs and interest rates as research commentary focus
- HTTP bridge mcp-use integration in prototype, with sophisticated wrappers in later phases

**Impact Assessment:**
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Significant Enhancement** (enhanced agent infrastructure with lifecycle management)
- Integration of comprehensive data/news sources including Bloomberg Terminal API
- Implementation of 3-in-1 agent architecture with AgentBase foundation
- Migration from basic agent configurations to enhanced infrastructure system
- Multi-domain development capabilities with usage analytics

**Integration Bridge**: HTTP API (FastAPI ‚Üî Express) for Python-TypeScript communication
**News Access**: Free news APIs (NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Google News)
**Existing Dependencies**: Most infrastructure already in place (mcp-use, pydantic, aiohttp, langchain)
**Minimal Additions**: langgraph, fastapi, express, news API client libraries

### Phase 2 Technical Stack (TBD)
**Quantitative Libraries**: TBD (candidates: numpy, pandas, scipy, quantlib)
**Calculation Frameworks**: TBD based on performance requirements
**Data Processing**: TBD (streaming vs batch processing decision pending)
**Visualization**: TBD (candidates: matplotlib, plotly, d3.js)

### Phase 3 Technical Stack (TBD)
**Application Frameworks**: TBD based on use case requirements
**UI Libraries**: TBD (React, Vue, or native solutions)
**Deployment Infrastructure**: TBD (containerization, cloud platforms)
**API Frameworks**: TBD (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket requirements)

### Integration Approach

**MCP Integration Strategy**: Direct mcp-use client integration with Bloomberg Terminal API in Phase 1, expanding to multi-server configuration (Yahoo Finance, Google News, Reuters) in Phase 2

**Agent Communication Strategy**: LangGraph state management with Pydantic schemas from Phase 1 (not dicts), HTTP bridge for tool access

**Model Integration Strategy**:
- Planning Agent: Manual BMAD coordination (Phase 1) evolving to automated orchestration
- All Agents: LangGraph + Anthropic integration with Claude Sonnet for cost-effective operation
- Complex Planning: Claude Opus for sophisticated workflow generation when needed

**Tool Access Strategy**: mcp-use library enables dynamic multi-server configuration and simultaneous tool access across multiple data sources without pre-configuration complexity

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach** (Root Directory Integration):
```
MADF/ (root)                 # All new directories at root level - no prototype/ subdirectory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                  # NEW - LangGraph agent nodes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ langgraph_core/          # NEW - LangGraph orchestration & Pydantic models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_bridge/              # NEW - HTTP API bridge (Python ‚Üî TypeScript)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                 # EXISTING - keep as is
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json             # EXISTING - add express
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt         # EXISTING - add langgraph, fastapi
```
**Naming Conventions**: Production-ready structure from day 1, no refactoring needed
**Coding Standards**: Python-first with LangGraph patterns, basic error handling in Phase 1
**Documentation Standards**: Maintain existing `docs/` structure with prototype documentation and learnings
**Data Access Strategy**: Bloomberg Terminal API (news focus) + CSV historical data (d:\data for price verification) + newsapi fallback
### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Leverage existing npm scripts structure, add enhanced agent startup commands
**Configuration Management**: Extend existing dotenv patterns for financial API keys and data source credentials
**Monitoring and Logging**: Implement error tracking system building on existing tool analytics framework
**Environment Setup**: Document financial data source API key requirements and setup procedures

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- mcp-use library compatibility with target financial data sources and async operations (Mitigation: Early integration testing with all MCP servers)
- LangChain Anthropic API cost escalation from Sonnet usage in multiple agents (Mitigation: Strict budget monitoring and request optimization)
- Python async performance bottlenecks with concurrent mcp-use operations (Mitigation: Performance profiling and connection pooling)
- mcp-use multi-server configuration complexity and debugging challenges (Mitigation: Comprehensive logging and staged rollout)

**Integration Risks**:
- Conflicts between mcp-use Python agents and existing Node.js MADF infrastructure (Mitigation: Clear separation of concerns and dedicated configurations)
- MCP server resource contention between Claude Code and mcp-use agent access (Mitigation: Dedicated financial MCP server instances)
- File system communication bottlenecks with hybrid coordination approach (Mitigation: Lightweight JSON message design and async processing)

**Deployment Risks**:
- 5-7 day timeline pressure leading to technical debt with complex mcp-use setup (Mitigation: Focus on MVP functionality, use simple configurations)
- API rate limiting from financial data sources accessed via MCP servers (Mitigation: Implement caching and request throttling in mcp-use configuration) - MVP focuses on qualitative news data to minimize API usage
- Python environment dependencies conflicting with existing Node.js setup (Mitigation: Virtual environment isolation and dependency management)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive error logging for rapid debugging
- Use existing MADF analytics patterns for performance monitoring
- Maintain fallback to manual research if automated agents fail
