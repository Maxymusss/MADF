I want **research agents that access real-time financial data through multiple MCP servers using mcp-use library**,
so that **market intelligence reports contain current, accurate information from diverse sources**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Research agent uses async Python implementation with mcp-use library for multi-server configuration
2. Agent integrates LangChain Anthropic (Sonnet) for cost-effective tool calling capabilities
3. Agent implements multi-server configuration accessing Yahoo Finance, Google News via dedicated MCP servers
4. Agent implements time filtering with "This week" = Monday 8 days before ask-date including weekends
5. Agent focuses exclusively on Asia/G10 currencies and interest rate markets using targeted MCP server queries
6. Agent maintains individual error logs for learning system development
7. Agent communicates with Product Manager through established JSON message format while using mcp-use for data access

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: mcp-use agent Python environment integrates cleanly with existing Node.js MADF infrastructure
- IV2: Agent MCP server connections use dedicated configurations that do not conflict with Claude Code MCP setup
- IV3: Agent resource usage (Python + async operations) stays within 20% memory increase limit established in NFR1

## Story 1.3: Financial Data Source MCP Server Configuration

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **dedicated MCP servers configured for financial data sources that integrate with mcp-use library**,
so that **research agents can access current market information through programmatic multi-server setup**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Financial MCP servers (Yahoo Finance, Google News, Reuters) configured with proper command/HTTP endpoints
2. mcp-use multi-server configuration enables simultaneous access to all financial data sources
3. MCP server configurations support both command-based and HTTP-based connections as needed
4. All MCP servers implement proper error handling compatible with mcp-use async operations
5. API key management integrates with existing dotenv environment setup and mcp-use configuration
6. MCP servers provide tools specifically optimized for Asia/G10 FX and interest rate data access

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Financial MCP servers operate independently from Claude Code MCP configurations
- IV2: mcp-use multi-server configuration does not interfere with existing MADF MCP wrapper utilities
- IV3: MCP server performance supports concurrent access from multiple Python agents without bottlenecks

## Story 1.4: Validator Agent Cross-Reference System

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **a validator agent using mcp-use library that fact-checks research outputs against authoritative sources**,
so that **final reports maintain high accuracy and credibility through automated cross-validation**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Validator agent uses mcp-use library with async Python implementation and LangChain Anthropic integration
2. Agent accesses Reuters/AP News through dedicated MCP server configurations via mcp-use multi-server setup
3. Agent cross-references research outputs using mcp-use tool calling against authoritative sources
4. Agent identifies conflicts between multiple research agent outputs with MCP server source attribution
5. Agent provides conflict resolution recommendations with confidence scoring and source citations
6. Agent flags timing inaccuracies and outdated information for correction using time-aware MCP queries
7. Agent integrates validation results into Product Manager compilation workflow through JSON messaging

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Validator agent mcp-use configuration shares financial MCP servers with research agents without conflicts
- IV2: Validation results integrate seamlessly with existing file-based communication protocol
- IV3: Agent async validation processes do not exceed established performance budgets or memory limits

## Story 1.5: Agent Coordination and Communication Protocol

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **a robust communication protocol between all agents**,
so that **the system operates reliably and can recover from failures**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. File-based JSON messaging enables crash-resilient agent coordination
2. Message format supports task distribution, progress updates, and result aggregation
3. Protocol handles agent failures with automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
4. Communication logs provide debugging information for system optimization
5. Protocol scales to accommodate additional research agent variants

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Communication protocol files integrate with existing `.claude/` structure and permissions
- IV2: File-based messaging does not interfere with existing MADF file operations
- IV3: Protocol performance meets 48-hour implementation timeline requirements

## Story 1.6: Error Tracking and Learning System Foundation

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **comprehensive error tracking across all agents**,
so that **the system learns from mistakes and improves accuracy over time**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each agent maintains detailed error logs with categorization and timestamping
2. Error tracking integrates with existing MADF analytics framework patterns
3. System tracks accuracy metrics for research validation and improvement
4. Error categorization supports future machine learning integration
5. Human feedback integration enables supervised learning capabilities

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Error tracking files follow existing analytics directory structure and naming conventions
- IV2: Error logging integrates with existing tool usage analytics without data conflicts
- IV3: Learning system foundation supports future Phase 2 ML enhancement integration

## Story 1.7: Weekly Report Generation and Output

As a **financial research system operator**,
I want **automated generation of comprehensive weekly market intelligence reports**,
so that **stakeholders receive timely, accurate Asia/G10 FX and interest rate analysis**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System generates weekly reports covering Asia/G10 currency movements and interest rate changes
2. Reports include validated research findings with source citations and confidence indicators
3. Output format supports both human consumption and potential API integration
