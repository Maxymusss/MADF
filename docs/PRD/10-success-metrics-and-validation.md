**Note:** This expanded PRD structure maintains the 48-hour Phase 1 timeline while establishing a clear vision for evolving the framework into a self-improving agentic working group. Each phase's project deliveries act as training grounds, with concrete sub-projects providing value while continuously enhancing agent capabilities.
