# 8. Success Metrics and Validation

## Phase 1 Success Criteria (Prototype Validation)
- ✓ 4-agent LangGraph system operational within 2-3 weeks (Planning + Research + Dev + PM)
- ✓ Research commentary successfully generated with Bloomberg news + price verification
- ✓ Manual BMAD planning workflow demonstrated with structured output
- ✓ HTTP bridge operational (Python LangGraph ↔ TypeScript mcp-use)
- ✓ Bloomberg Terminal API + CSV data access functional
- ✓ Agent coordination through Pydantic state management proven functional
- ✓ Factual accuracy validation + human quality check demonstrated
- ✓ Root directory structure established (no refactoring needed for production)

## Phase 2 Success Criteria (Sophistication Validation)
- ✓ Advanced Pydantic validation rules reduce state management errors by 80%
- ✓ Automated ValidationAgent catches 90% of quality issues before human review
- ✓ HITL dashboard enables efficient human oversight with <2 minute review time
- ✓ Multi-server mcp-use configuration supports 3+ data sources simultaneously
- ✓ Error handling and replanning logic resolves 80% of failures automatically
- ✓ LangSmith observability provides comprehensive workflow monitoring

## Phase 3 Success Criteria (TBD)
- TBD: Application generation time targets
- TBD: Code quality metrics
- TBD: Deployment success rates
- TBD: User satisfaction scores
- TBD: Autonomous operation percentage

## Learning Framework Metrics
- Error reduction rate per project cycle
- Agent decision accuracy improvements
- Time to complete similar tasks (learning curve)
- Human intervention frequency (autonomy measure)
- Knowledge transfer between project types

**Note:** This revised PRD implements a prototype-first approach with a realistic 2-3 week Phase 1 timeline, establishing a 4-layer architecture (Claude Code → BMAD → LangGraph → mcp-use) that scales incrementally. The framework starts with simple implementations and adds sophistication as proven valuable, enabling rapid research commentary delivery while building toward production-grade multi-agent capabilities.
