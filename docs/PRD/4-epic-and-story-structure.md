# 4. Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Three-phase epic structure aligned with platform evolution roadmap.

**Rationale**:
- Phase 1 (Epic 1): Establishes prototype foundation with basic LangGraph multi-agent system (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 2 (Epic 2): Adds sophistication layer with schemas, validation, and HITL (4-5 weeks)
- Phase 3 (Epic 3): Implements production features with advanced analytics and deployment (ongoing)

This prototype-first approach enables rapid value delivery through research commentary generation while establishing the foundation for sophisticated multi-agent capabilities. Each phase builds incrementally on proven functionality.
