# 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** 3-in-1 agent architecture analysis

**Current Project State:**
The Multi-Agent Development Framework (MADF) implements a prototype-first, layered architecture for AI-driven development workflows. The framework provides:
- **LangGraph Orchestration Core**: State-based graph execution with persistence and observability
- **4-Layer Integration**: Claude Code (interface) ‚Üí BMAD (planning) ‚Üí LangGraph (execution) ‚Üí mcp-use (tools)
- **Bloomberg Data Integration**: Real Terminal API (localhost:8194) with mock fallback for development
- **Prototype Architecture**: Simple implementations that scale to sophisticated features incrementally
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Planning, Research, Development, and PM agents with clear handoffs
- **Human-BMAD Integration**: Manual planning workflow that evolves to automated coordination
- Research commentary generation for Asia/G10 FX pairs and interest rates

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ‚òëÔ∏è **New Framework Implementation** (Primary)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Multi-Agent Orchestration** (LangGraph state machine with 4 agents)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Tool Integration Architecture** (mcp-use for Bloomberg and financial data access)

**Enhancement Description:**
Implement a prototype-first multi-agent development platform using a 4-layer architecture: Claude Code for user interface, BMAD for strategic planning, LangGraph for multi-agent execution, and mcp-use for tool integration. The system starts with simplified implementations (Pydantic state models, manual BMAD chat, HTTP bridge tool access) and evolves incrementally to sophisticated features (validation automation, HITL dashboards, advanced error handling). This approach enables rapid value delivery while establishing the foundation for production-grade capabilities.

**Core Innovation - Prototype-First Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- LangGraph state machine orchestrates 4 specialized agents with clear handoffs
- BMAD planning layer generates structured workflows through human-agent collaboration
- mcp-use tool layer provides secure, multi-server access to Bloomberg and financial data
- Incremental sophistication: Start simple, add schemas/automation/validation as proven valuable
- Claude Code integration maintains familiar user experience

**Three-Phase Evolution:**
- Phase 1: Prototype Foundation (2-3 weeks). Basic LangGraph with 4 agents, manual BMAD planning, direct mcp-use integration
- Phase 2: Sophistication Layer (4-5 weeks). Add schemas, automated validation, HITL dashboards, error handling
- Phase 3: Production Features (ongoing). Advanced analytics, application generation, deployment automation

**Bloomberg Integration Strategy:**
- Real Bloomberg Terminal API (localhost:8194) via mcp-use client for production accuracy
- Mock Bloomberg service for development environment testing
- Asia/G10 FX pairs and interest rates as research commentary focus
- HTTP bridge mcp-use integration in prototype, with sophisticated wrappers in later phases

**Impact Assessment:**
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Significant Enhancement** (enhanced agent infrastructure with lifecycle management)
- Integration of comprehensive data/news sources including Bloomberg Terminal API
- Implementation of 3-in-1 agent architecture with AgentBase foundation
- Migration from basic agent configurations to enhanced infrastructure system
- Multi-domain development capabilities with usage analytics

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**

**Phase 1 Goals (Prototype Foundation, 2-3 weeks):**
‚Ä¢ Deploy basic LangGraph with 4-agent system: Planning + Research + Dev + PM agents
‚Ä¢ Implement manual BMAD planning workflow (human chat with BMAD agent)
‚Ä¢ Establish direct mcp-use integration with Bloomberg Terminal API
‚Ä¢ Deliver first research commentary demonstrating multi-agent coordination
‚Ä¢ Create structured state management with Pydantic models from Phase 1
‚Ä¢ Validate core architecture pattern with minimal viable implementation
‚Ä¢ Output research commentary to hedgemonkey project directory directory

**Phase 2 Goals (Sophistication Layer, 4-5 weeks):**
‚Ä¢ Add Pydantic schemas for structured state management and validation
‚Ä¢ Implement automated ValidationAgent for quality checks and acceptance criteria
‚Ä¢ Create HITL dashboard for human oversight and approval workflows
‚Ä¢ Add sophisticated error handling, retry logic, and replanning capabilities
‚Ä¢ Expand HTTP bridge mcp-use integration with tool wrappers and fallback mechanisms
‚Ä¢ Evaluate tmux integration for multi-agent session management and monitoring
‚Ä¢ Integrate advanced analytics capabilities with existing alphaseek project

**Phase 3 Goals (Production Features, ongoing):**
‚Ä¢ Implement quantitative analytics engine with specialized calculation agents
‚Ä¢ Build reusable component libraries for financial analysis workflows
‚Ä¢ Add autonomous coding capabilities with full testing and validation
‚Ä¢ Enable application scaffolding and deployment automation
‚Ä¢ Implement tmux-based development environment for enterprise multi-agent workflows
‚Ä¢ Scale to enterprise-grade features based on production learnings
‚Ä¢ Full integration with alphaseek project for advanced analytics

**Background Context:**
The current AI development landscape lacks sophisticated multi-agent coordination frameworks with proper lifecycle management and permissions. This enhancement addresses the critical need for reliable multi-agent development platforms by implementing an enhanced agent validation system. The approach leverages the existing MADF MCP infrastructure while adding comprehensive multi-agent capabilities, focusing on the concrete use case of research commentary projects where agent coordination accuracy is mission-critical for project delivery.
