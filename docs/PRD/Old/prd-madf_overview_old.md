# Multi-Agent Development Framework (MADF) - PRD

## Introduction/Overview

The Multi-Agent Development Framework (MADF) is a pragmatic system for coordinating development across multiple mature projects. After analyzing existing codebases, we discovered that alphaseek and TotoRich are sophisticated, production-ready platforms requiring integration optimization rather than migration. The framework coordinates multi-agent workflows to improve development velocity and enable component sharing.

## Goals

1. Build madfm multi-agent framework management system
2. Integrate alphaseek quantitative finance platform into unified workflow  
3. Coordinate TotoRich full-stack financial platform development
4. Enable component sharing across project ecosystem
5. Optimize development velocity through intelligent automation
6. Establish factor-based architectures for trading strategies

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to coordinate development across multiple projects so that I can reuse components efficiently and avoid duplicate work
- As a quant developer, I want to develop and backtest trading factors so that I can optimize for high Sharpe ratios with risk management
- As a project manager, I want automated task distribution so that work is assigned to the most suitable agents based on expertise
- As a team lead, I want performance monitoring so that I can track agent effectiveness and make data-driven decisions

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must implement 3 core agents: Research Agent, PM Agent, HR Agent
2. The system must support HR-managed dynamic agent creation based on task patterns set by PM
3. The system must create specialist agents (Implementation, Testing, Database, API, Frontend, Security) as needed
4. The system must integrate with existing alphaseek and TotoRich codebases with migration
5. The system must implement agent performance monitoring with 15 task evaluation cycles
6. The system must support event-driven task assignment rather than rigid schedules
7. The system must track trust scores based on task completion, build success, and human override rates
8. The system must implement mandatory TDD for all non-trivial tasks, test done by testing agent
9. The system must support component extraction and reuse across projects

## Technical Considerations

- Built on Claude Code with MCP server integrations (Taskmaster, Context7, Notion, Sequential Thinking, Github, Playwright, Filesystem)
- Event-driven architecture with GitHub Actions and cron job automation
- Agent configuration via `.claude/agents/` json files with persona definitions
- Performance monitoring through automated trust score calculations
- Budget monitoring with automatic token/time limit protocols
- Integration existing mature architectures into new architecture

## Success Metrics

- Development velocity increase by 30% within 3 months
- Code reuse across projects > 40%
- Agent task completion rate > 85%
- Average agent trust score > 70 within 2 months
- Framework ROI > 100% by month 3, > 200% by month 6
- Cost efficiency: Framework cost < 30% of time savings value

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle agent context allocation?
2. How often should we evaluate and potentially retire underperforming agents?
