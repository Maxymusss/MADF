# MADF: Multi-Agent Development Framework – PRD

**Problem:** Disjointed development across mature projects (alphaseek: 80k LOC, 80% coverage) causes redundant effort and slow delivery. Teams work in silos without coordination.

**Objective:** Deploy multi-agent coordination platform to accelerate velocity (30%+ feature throughput), enable component reuse (40%+), and achieve break-even ROI in 2-3 months.

**Stakeholders:** Project teams (alphaseek, TotoRich), PM/HR agents, DevOps leads, system architects.

## Core Requirements

1. **Two-Layer Architecture:** Strategic Control Plane (LangGraph StateGraph orchestration) + Execution Plane (Claude agent specialists) via MCP Bridge
2. **Smart Task Routing:** 4-node workflow pattern (TaskIntake → Research → Implementation → QualityAssurance) with auto-classification and specialist routing
3. **Adaptive Scaling:** Agent allocation by project maturity (Prototype: 1-2 agents → Scale: full fleet)
4. **Component Extraction:** Promote stable, generalizable components (≥2 weeks unchanged, <10% modification for reuse)
5. **Context Engineering Layer:** Advanced project context injection and domain-specific knowledge synthesis
6. **Ultrathink Capability:** Deep reasoning and multi-step problem decomposition for complex technical challenges
7. **AlphaSeek Two-Arm Model:** Infrastructure arm (platform dev) + Research arm (strategy dev) with shared components
8. **Real-time Monitoring:** Track velocity, reuse rate, trust scores, ROI progression via dashboard  

## Technical Requirements

- **Performance:** Task routing <5s, research responses <60s, critical task assignment <20min, >99% uptime
- **Success Metrics:** 80% task success rate, <20% error rate per agent evaluation cycle (20 tasks)
- **Security:** Sandboxed execution environments, read-only code access, automated security scanning
- **Cost Control:** Operations <30% of time savings, auto-throttling at 60%/75%/85% budget thresholds
- **Integration:** Task Master MCP bridge, existing CI/CD compatibility, `.claude/agents/` config reuse
- **State Management:** JSON persistence, workflow transparency, comprehensive error logging  

## Key Workflows

- **Feature Development:** TaskIntake → Research analysis → Implementation routing → QualityAssurance validation
- **Critical Bugs:** Auto-classify → interrupt workflow → <20min assignment
- **Agent Management:** Performance tracking → configuration refinement → evaluation cycles (every 20 tasks)
- **Component Reuse:** Automated pattern recognition → stability assessment → cross-project promotion via dictionary
- **Context Evolution:** Domain knowledge extraction → context engineering updates → capability enhancement
