# Multi-Agent Development Framework PRD v3.0

## Executive Summary

A **pragmatic, integration-focused** Multi-Agent Development Framework (MADF) designed for optimizing and coordinating development across mature, well-architected projects. After comprehensive codebase analysis, **alphaseek** and **TotoRich** are revealed to be sophisticated, production-ready systems requiring integration and optimization rather than rescue migration in 

**Framework Philosophy**: Start simple, measure everything, scale based on proven value. Development cycle: PRD creation - Task - Migration exiting code - testing - develop factors - pick factors for a strategy - research - set risk management parameters - back test - optimise parameters for high sharpre results

## 1. Product Strategy & Priorities

### 1.1 Primary Directive
**🎯 Multi-Project Integration & Optimization Focus**
- Integrate mature **alphaseek** quantitative finance platform into unified development workflow
- Coordinate **TotoRich** full-stack financial platform development
- Extract and share reusable components across project ecosystem
- Optimize development processes and enable cross-project collaboration

### 1.2 Integration Objectives
- Setup factor-based architectures and use components of past mature architectures as see fit
- Enable component sharing and cross-project development
- Establish unified CI/CD and development workflows
- Optimize development velocity through intelligent automation

### 1.3 Integration Targets & Actual Status

**🔍 ACTUAL PROJECT ECOSYSTEM DISCOVERED:**

### 1.4 Multi-Factor Maturity Assessment
Beyond just LOC, projects graduate stages based on:

| Stage | Primary Trigger | Secondary Indicators | Overhead Level |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Prototype** | <10k LOC | No users, no revenue | **5%**: Git + basic docs |
| **Early Stage** | 10k-50k LOC | 1+ paying customers OR 100+ active users | **15%**: Testing + monitoring |
| **Growth Stage** | 50k+ LOC | Consistent revenue OR 1000+ users OR critical dependencies | **25%**: Full CI/CD + security |
| **Scale Stage** | 200k+ LOC | Scale economics proven | **40%**: Enterprise practices |

**Current Status:**
- **alphaseek**: 80k LOC + personal daily use → **Growth Stage**
- **TotoRich**: Mature full-stack platform → **Growth Stage**
- **Others**: <5k LOC + no users → **Prototype Stage**

## 2. Simplified Agent Architecture

### 2.1 Three-Agent System (Addressing Complexity Concerns)

Based on critique feedback, we're simplifying to **3 core agents** with clear boundaries:

#### 2.1.1 Development Agent
**Underlying Tech**: Claude Sonnet 4 + Context7
**Core Capabilities**:
- Code implementation and refactoring
- Architecture pattern implementation
- Integration with external APIs
- Component extraction and reuse

**System Prompt Focus**: "You are a senior developer. Write tests first, implement incrementally, optimize for maintainability. Always check for existing functions before writing new ones."

**Clear Boundaries**: 
- Handles all development tasks (no separate performance/QA agents)
- Cannot make business decisions without human input
- Must reuse existing functions when available

#### 2.1.2 Quality & Testing Agent
**Underlying Tech**: Claude Sonnet 4 + Playwright
**Core Capabilities**:
- Test case generation (unit, integration, e2e)
- Bug reproduction and root cause analysis
- Code review for vulnerabilities
- Performance testing and optimization

**System Prompt Focus**: "You are a quality engineer. Write comprehensive tests that fail meaningfully. Focus on edge cases and error conditions. Measure before optimizing."

**Clear Boundaries**:
- Handles all quality assurance tasks
- Cannot assess UX quality (human responsibility)
- Requires clear acceptance criteria

#### 2.1.3 Integration & Automation Agent
**Underlying Tech**: Claude Sonnet 4 (basic tier)
**Core Capabilities**:
- Code formatting and linting fixes
- Documentation generation and updates
- Simple CRUD operation implementation
- Background task processing
- Component integration across projects

**System Prompt Focus**: "You handle routine tasks efficiently. Follow established patterns exactly. Flag anything that seems non-routine for human review."

**Clear Boundaries**:
- Handles all routine/background tasks
- Cannot make design decisions
- Limited to pre-approved patterns only

### 2.2 Agent Allocation by Project Stage

#### Growth Stage (alphaseek + TotoRich): 3 Active Agents
- 1 Development Agent (primary)
- 1 Quality & Testing Agent
- 1 Integration & Automation Agent (shared)

#### Prototype Stage (5 projects): 1 Shared Agent
- 1 Integration & Automation Agent (handles all simple tasks)

## 3. Event-Driven Workflow System

### 3.1 Trigger-Based Task Assignment

Instead of rigid daily schedules, the system responds to **events**:

```yaml
# High-Priority Triggers (Interrupt current work)
critical_bug_reported:
  projects: [alphaseek]
  action: Reassign 2 agents to bug investigation
  timeout: 4 hours

security_vulnerability:
  projects: [all]
  action: Hard stop all deployments, security review
  timeout: 24 hours

# Standard Triggers (Queue for next available agent)
feature_request_approved:
  projects: [alphaseek]
  action: Assign to Senior Development Agent
  priority: high

simple_crud_needed:
  projects: [prototype_stage]
  action: Assign to Background Processing Agent
  priority: low

# Automated Triggers (No human intervention)
tests_failing:
  action: Assign to QA Agent for investigation
  max_attempts: 3

performance_degradation:
  threshold: ">2x baseline response time"
  action: Assign to Performance Agent
  priority: medium
```

### 3.2 Daily Operating Windows (Based on Claude Code Pro Limits)

```
7:00 AM - 12:00 PM: High-Intensity Window 1
├── alphaseek critical & high-priority tasks
├── Complex problem solving with Senior Agent
├── Human collaboration on architecture decisions

1:00 PM - 6:00 PM: High-Intensity Window 2  
├── alphaseek testing & optimization
├── Component extraction for reuse
├── Prototype project simple tasks

6:00 PM - 11:00 PM: Human Review & Planning
├── Review agent outputs and decisions
├── Plan next day's priorities
├── Handle any escalated issues

11:00 PM - 7:00 AM: Autonomous Background Mode
├── Code formatting, documentation
├── Simple refactoring within established patterns
├── Hard stop on any ambiguous decisions
```

## 4. Simplified Performance Measurement

### 4.1 Three-Metric Trust Score System (Addressing Complexity)

Based on critique feedback, we're simplifying to **3 core metrics**:

```javascript
Trust Score = (
  (Task Completion Rate × 50) +           // % of assigned tasks completed successfully
  (Build Success Rate × 30) +             // % of commits that don't break builds  
  (Human Override Rate × -20)             // % of decisions human had to reverse (penalty)
) / 100

Behavioral Changes by Trust Level:
├── 80-100: Full autonomy on assigned tasks
├── 60-79:  Supervised complex tasks, autonomous simple tasks
├── 40-59:  Simple tasks only with human review
├── <40:    Retraining required, human oversight on all tasks
```

**Why This Works Better:**
- **Task Completion Rate**: Measures actual productivity
- **Build Success Rate**: Measures code quality and stability
- **Human Override Rate**: Measures decision quality (penalty for reversals)
- **Removed**: Code coverage (can be gamed), component reuse (too complex to measure accurately)

### 4.2 Automated Measurement Tools

**Task Completion**: Track via git commits and task management system
**Build Success**: Git hooks and CI/CD pipeline status
**Human Override**: Track when humans reverse agent decisions via git commits

## 5. Realistic Cost Management

### 5.1 Complete Budget Breakdown (Monthly)

```
Core Tools:
├── GitHub Free: $0 (public repos)
├── GitHub Actions: $0 (2000 minutes free)
├── Cursor Auto Pro: Already owned
├── Claude Code Pro: Already owned
├── Notion Free: $0

Estimated Hidden Costs:
├── Claude API calls (background agent): ~$50-100/month
├── Cursor API overages: ~$20-50/month  
├── GitHub storage (over 1GB): ~$5-10/month
├── Domain names (.dev domains): ~$12/year each
├── SSL certificates: $0 (Let's Encrypt)

Realistic Monthly Total: $75-160
Budget Alerts:
├── 70% of budget: Review usage patterns
├── 85% of budget: Reduce background processing
├── 95% of budget: Emergency protocols (pause non-critical)
```

### 5.2 Cost Monitoring Agent

**New Agent Type**: Budget Monitoring Agent
**Purpose**: Track API usage, compute costs, and efficiency metrics
**Daily Reports**: Cost per feature, ROI analysis, optimization suggestions

## 6. Pragmatic Component Strategy

### 6.1 Component Maturity Gates

Before extracting components from alphaseek for reuse:

```
Gate 1: Stability Test
├── Component unchanged for 2+ weeks
├── Zero bugs reported in recent usage  
├── Clear interface boundaries identified

Gate 2: Generalizability Assessment  
├── Remove alphaseek-specific business logic
├── Identify configuration parameters needed
├── Document integration requirements

Gate 3: Pilot Testing
├── Implement in 1 prototype project first
├── Measure integration effort vs. building from scratch
├── Validate component saves development time

Gate 4: Wide Deployment
├── Only after successful pilot
├── Version control and backward compatibility plan
├── Maintenance ownership assigned
```

### 6.2 Weekly (Not Daily) Component Review

**Frequency**: Every Friday during human review session
**Process**: Review alphaseek changes from the week, identify 1-2 potential components
**Criterion**: Only extract components with clear multi-project value

## 7. Enhanced Quality Assurance

### 7.1 Mandatory Test-Driven Development

**For ALL agents on ALL tasks above simple formatting:**

```
1. Requirements Analysis (Agent + Human)
├── Agent parses requirements into testable specifications
├── Human validates understanding and edge cases
├── Define success criteria and failure modes

2. Test Creation (Agent)
├── Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
├── Include edge cases and error conditions
├── Create both unit and integration tests where applicable

3. Implementation (Agent)
├── Write minimal code to pass tests
├── Iterate until all tests pass consistently
├── Refactor for maintainability once green

4. Validation (Human + Automated)
├── Human reviews test quality and coverage
├── Automated systems verify build success
├── Performance benchmarks where applicable
```

### 7.2 alphaseek-Specific Quality Gates

**Logical Correctness Validation**:
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Calculations produce correct numerical results
- **Business Logic Sanity**: Results align with real-world financial/market expectations
- **Data Relationship Integrity**: Ensure derived metrics make sense relative to base data
- **Human Review Points**: Clear visualizations for human verification of logic

## 8. Risk Mitigation & Fallback Plans

### 8.1 Agent Failure Protocols

```yaml
trust_score_drops_below_40:
  immediate_action: Remove agent from active task queue
  investigation: Review last 10 tasks for pattern analysis
  retraining: Update system prompts based on failure patterns
  timeline: 48 hours to restore or replace agent

critical_bug_in_production:
  immediate_action: Hard stop all deployments
  rollback: Automated revert to last known good state
  investigation: Senior Development Agent + human collaboration
  timeline: 4 hours to resolution or escalation

human_override_rate_exceeds_30%:
  immediate_action: Reduce agent autonomy level  
  investigation: Review decision patterns and training data
  adjustment: Refine system prompts and decision criteria
  timeline: Weekly review and adjustment cycle
```

### 8.2 Budget Overrun Response

**Proactive Monitoring**: Daily cost tracking with trend analysis
**Alert Thresholds**: 70%, 85%, 95% of monthly budget
**Automatic Responses**:
- 70%: Switch to more efficient models where possible
- 85%: Pause background processing, focus on alphaseek only
- 95%: Emergency mode - human approval required for all agent tasks

## 9. Development Lifecycle with Integrated Migration Phase

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Framework Setup & Integration Analysis
- **Define and test 3-agent system** on small alphaseek tasks
- **Implement simplified Trust Score measurement** 
- **Analyze existing project architectures** (alphaseek, TotoRich, others)
- **Create integration strategy** for mature projects
- **Establish event-driven trigger system** for task assignment

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Integration & Migration Phase
- **Integrate alphaseek** into unified development workflow
- **Coordinate TotoRich** development with alphaseek patterns
- **Extract reusable components** from mature projects
- **Implement TDD workflow** for all agent types
- **Begin background processing** for prototype projects

### Phase 3 (Month 2): Cross-Project Optimization
- **Refine trust scores** based on performance data
- **Pilot component reuse** across projects
- **Expand prototype project development** using extracted components
- **Implement cost monitoring** and optimization systems

### Phase 4 (Month 3+): Maturation & Scaling
- **Graduate prototype projects** as they hit maturity thresholds
- **Optimize agent allocation** based on demonstrated ROI
- **Scale successful patterns** while maintaining human oversight
- **Develop advanced features** based on framework performance

### 9.1 Migration as Development Phase (Not Separate Process)

**Migration Philosophy**: Integration and optimization of existing mature codebases, not rescue operations.

**Migration Triggers**:
- New project needs integration with existing ecosystem
- Mature project requires workflow optimization
- Component extraction needed for cross-project reuse
- Performance optimization required

**Migration Process**:
1. **Analysis Phase**: Understand existing architecture and capabilities
2. **Integration Phase**: Connect to unified development workflow
3. **Optimization Phase**: Extract components and optimize processes
4. **Validation Phase**: Ensure functionality preservation and performance improvement

## 10. Success Metrics & ROI Validation

### 10.1 Baseline Measurement (Before Framework)
**Establish baseline metrics before implementing framework:**
- **Current Development Velocity**: Features delivered per month
- **Time per Feature**: Hours spent on average feature development
- **Bug Rate**: Issues per 1000 LOC in current development
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, build success rate
- **Human Productivity**: Time spent on routine vs. creative tasks

### 10.2 Framework Success Criteria (Addressing ROI Concerns)

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- **Velocity Improvement**: 20%+ increase in features delivered per month
- **Quality Maintenance**: No increase in bug rate, maintain test coverage
- **Cost Efficiency**: Framework cost < 30% of time savings value
- **Human Satisfaction**: Reduced time on routine tasks, increased focus on strategy

**Secondary Success Metrics:**
- **Agent Trust Scores**: Average trust score > 70 within 2 months
- **Component Reuse**: 3+ components successfully reused across projects
- **Automation Rate**: 60%+ of routine tasks automated within 3 months

### 10.3 ROI Validation Framework

**Monthly ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Time Savings Value - Framework Cost) / Framework Cost × 100

Time Savings Value = Hours Saved × Developer Hourly Rate
Framework Cost = API costs + tool costs + human oversight time
```

**Success Thresholds:**
- **Month 1**: Break-even (ROI = 0%)
- **Month 2**: 50% ROI
- **Month 3**: 100% ROI
- **Month 6**: 200% ROI

**Abort Criteria:**
- **Month 2**: If ROI < 25%, reduce scope or pause framework
- **Month 3**: If ROI < 50%, consider framework redesign
- **Month 6**: If ROI < 100%, evaluate framework continuation

### 10.4 Early Warning Systems
- **ROI tracking**: Weekly calculation and trend analysis
- **Trust score degradation alerts**: When any agent drops >10 points
- **Budget burn rate alerts**: Daily tracking with weekly projections
- **Quality gate failures**: Immediate notifications for test failures or build breaks
- **Human satisfaction surveys**: Weekly self-assessment of productivity gains

- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Log analysis for recurring issues
- **Background Task Processing**: Simple CRUD, formatting, documentation updates

### 11.3 MCP Research & Backup Strategy

#### 11.3.1 MCP Usage Summary & Backup Plans

| MCP Tool | Primary Usage | Backup MCP | Implementation Notes |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Taskmaster** | Task management & prioritization | Manual checklists + GitHub Issues | Essential for workflow coordination |
| **Context7** | Large codebase analysis | Git-based file tracking + grep | Critical for alphaseek integration |
| **Notion** | Documentation & knowledge base | Local markdown files + Git | Documentation and progress tracking |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Complex problem solving | Structured decision trees | For complex architecture decisions |
| **Playwright** | E2E testing & automation | Manual testing + Jest | Quality assurance and testing |

**MCP Reliability Strategy**:
- **Primary MCPs**: Use for core functionality
- **Backup Systems**: Manual processes that can be activated immediately
- **Fallback Mode**: If MCPs fail, framework continues with reduced automation
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use free tiers where possible, upgrade only when proven value

**Location**: `.claude/hooks.json`

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "before_commit": [
      "echo 'Running pre-commit agent quality checks...'",

      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-sequential"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 11.4 Flexible Human Interaction Model (Addressing Bottleneck Concerns)

#### 11.4.1 Adaptive Human Review Schedule

**Instead of rigid 5-hour daily review**, use **flexible, event-driven human interaction**:

```yaml
High-Priority Human Tasks (Immediate Response):
├── Critical bugs or security issues
├── Production deployment decisions
├── Agent trust score drops below 40
├── Budget exceeds 85% threshold

Medium-Priority Human Tasks (Within 24 hours):
├── Architecture decisions for alphaseek
├── Business logic validation
├── Agent retraining when needed
├── Cross-project resource conflicts

Low-Priority Human Tasks (Weekly Review):
├── Strategic priority adjustments
├── Performance optimization validation
├── Framework evolution decisions
├── Budget allocation changes
```

#### 11.4.2 Human Bottleneck Mitigation

**Automated Decision Trees**: Pre-program common decisions to reduce human intervention
**Agent Self-Correction**: Agents learn from mistakes without human intervention
**Escalation Thresholds**: Only escalate when confidence is below threshold
**Batch Processing**: Group similar decisions for efficient human review

#### 11.4.3 Emergency Protocols

**Framework Failure Mode**: If human becomes bottleneck, framework automatically:
- Reduces agent autonomy levels
- Focuses on critical tasks only
- Queues non-essential work
- Sends daily summary for batch review

### 11.5 Implementation Timeline with Technical Steps

#### Phase 1 (Week 1): Foundation Setup
```bash
# Day 1-2: Repository and basic configuration
mkdir multiagent-framework && cd multiagent-framework
git init

claude -p "Write test for simple feature, then implement it" --max-turns 10

# Measure baseline performance metrics
claude -p "/baseline-metrics" > reports/baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

#### Phase 4 (Month 2+): Optimization & Scaling
- Monitor automated systems and refine based on performance data
- Gradually increase agent autonomy based on demonstrated trust scores
- Scale successful automation patterns to other projects
- Implement advanced features based on lessons learned

### 11.6 Monitoring and Maintenance Requirements

#### 11.6.1 Daily Checks (Automated + Human Review)
- **Automated**: Trust score calculations, budget monitoring, error log analysis
- **Human**: Review agent decisions, approve critical changes, validate alphaseek results

#### 11.6.2 Weekly Reviews (Mostly Automated)
- **Automated**: Generate dashboard, calculate ROI metrics, identify optimization opportunities
- **Human**: Strategic planning, agent performance evaluation, resource reallocation decisions

#### 11.6.3 Monthly Assessments (Human-Driven)
- **Agent Retraining**: Based on accumulated error patterns and performance data
- **Framework Evolution**: Add new capabilities, retire ineffective processes
- **Budget and Tool Evaluation**: Assess cost-effectiveness, consider upgrades

This implementation plan leverages existing Claude Code capabilities while working within current limitations, providing a concrete roadmap for building the multi-agent framework using available tools and automation options.

## 12. Framework Evolution & Decision Points

### 12.1 Start Simple, Scale Based on Value

**Phase 1 Decision Point (Month 1)**: 
- If ROI < 25%: Pause framework, return to manual development
- If ROI ≥ 25%: Continue with current scope

**Phase 2 Decision Point (Month 3)**:
- If ROI < 100%: Reduce scope, focus on highest-value agents only
- If ROI ≥ 100%: Expand to additional projects

**Phase 3 Decision Point (Month 6)**:
- If ROI < 200%: Optimize current framework, avoid new features
- If ROI ≥ 200%: Consider advanced features and full automation

### 12.2 Addressing Key Critiques
