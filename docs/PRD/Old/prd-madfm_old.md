# Multi-Agent Development Framework Management (MADFM) - PRD

## Product Overview

MADFM is the core multi-agent management system that coordinates development across multiple projects through intelligent agent orchestration. It implements an HR-managed dynamic agent architecture with 3 foundational agents and on-demand specialist creation.

## Goals

1. **Intelligent Agent Orchestration**: Deploy 3 foundational agents (Research, PM, HR) with dynamic specialist creation
2. **Performance-Based Management**: Implement empirical evaluation cycles for agent hire/fire decisions
3. **Event-Driven Task Assignment**: Replace rigid schedules with trigger-based workflows
4. **Cost-Effective Scaling**: Optimize resource allocation based on project maturity and performance data
5. **Trust-Based Autonomy**: Adaptive permission levels based on measured agent performance

## User Stories

- As a development manager, I want automated agent performance monitoring so that I can make data-driven decisions about agent effectiveness
- As a project coordinator, I want intelligent task assignment so that work is distributed to the most suitable agents based on expertise and availability
- As a cost-conscious developer, I want budget monitoring with automatic optimization so that framework costs remain under control
- As a team lead, I want trust-based autonomy levels so that proven agents can work independently while new agents require oversight

## Core Architecture

### 2.1 Foundational Team (Always Active)

**Research Agent**
- Role: Information gathering, codebase analysis, best practice research
- Outputs: Structured analysis reports, context packages, knowledge synthesis
- Key Functions: MCP/command/hooks research, error pattern analysis, improvement suggestions

**PM Agent**
- Role: Task coordination, context distribution, specialist requirements analysis
- Outputs: Task specifications, project timelines, agent assignments, progress reports
- Key Functions: Convert research to actionable tasks, manage dependencies, coordinate handoffs

**HR Agent**
- Role: Agent lifecycle management, performance monitoring, creation/retirement decisions
- Outputs: Performance reports, hiring/firing recommendations, optimization suggestions
- Key Functions: 15-task evaluation cycles, error analysis, agent fleet optimization

### 2.2 Dynamic Specialist Pool (HR-Managed)

Specialist agents created on-demand based on task pattern analysis:
- Implementation Agent (code generation, development)
- Testing Agent (quality assurance, test creation)
- Database Agent (schema design, optimization)
- API Agent (integration, documentation)
- Frontend Agent (UI/UX development)
- Security Agent (security analysis, hardening)

## Functional Requirements

### Core Agent Management
1. **Agent Creation System**: HR agent must analyze task patterns and propose specialist agent creation with specific job descriptions
2. **Performance Monitoring**: System must track task completion rates, build success rates, and human override frequencies
3. **Evaluation Cycles**: Each agent must be evaluated after 15 task cycles with empirical performance data
4. **Trust Score System**: Implement 3-metric trust scoring (Task Completion 50%, Build Success 30%, Human Override penalty -20%)
5. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjust agent count based on workload and performance metrics

### Event-Driven Workflow
1. **Trigger System**: Support high-priority (critical bugs), medium-priority (architecture decisions), and low-priority (weekly review) event triggers
2. **Context Distribution**: PM agent must provide appropriate context to specialist agents for task execution
3. **Dependency Management**: Track and resolve task dependencies across agents and projects
4. **Escalation Protocols**: Automatic human escalation when trust scores drop below thresholds

### Performance & Cost Management
1. **Budget Monitoring**: Daily cost tracking with 70%, 85%, 95% alert thresholds
2. **ROI Calculation**: Monthly ROI measurement with success thresholds (Month 1: 0%, Month 3: 100%, Month 6: 200%)
3. **Cost Optimization**: Automatic model switching and background processing reduction during budget constraints
4. **Performance Dashboards**: Weekly automated reporting on agent effectiveness and cost efficiency

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Platform
- **Base**: Claude Code with MCP server integrations
- **Configuration**: `.claude/agents/` JSON files with persona definitions  
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions and cron job scheduling
- **Storage**: Local JSON files for performance data, Notion for dashboards

### Trust Score Calculation
```
Trust Score = (Task Completion Rate × 50) + (Build Success Rate × 30) + (Human Override Rate × -20)

Behavioral Changes:
- 80-100: Full autonomy on assigned tasks
- 60-79: Supervised complex tasks, autonomous simple tasks  
- 40-59: Simple tasks only with human review
- <40: Retraining required, human oversight on all tasks
```

### Agent Evaluation Framework
- **Evaluation Period**: 15 task cycles per agent
- **Success Thresholds**: >80% task success, <2 errors per 10 tasks, >15% efficiency improvement
- **Decision Matrix**: Empirical data-driven hire/fire recommendations with confidence scores
- **Performance Tracking**: JSON logs with task results, duration, error counts, quality scores

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
- **Agent Fleet Efficiency**: Average trust score >70 within 2 months
- **Cost Control**: Framework cost <30% of time savings value
- **Performance Consistency**: >85% agent task completion rate
- **Human Satisfaction**: Reduced micromanagement, increased strategic focus

### Secondary Metrics
- **Response Time**: Agent task assignment <5 minutes for urgent tasks
- **Scalability**: Support 3-8 active agents based on project needs
- **Learning Rate**: Agent improvement >15% efficiency gain within evaluation cycles
- **System Uptime**: 99% availability for critical task assignment functions

## Risk Mitigation

### Agent Failure Protocols
- **Trust Score <40**: Remove from active queue, initiate retraining
- **High Error Rate**: Pattern analysis and system prompt refinement
- **Budget Overrun**: Automatic cost reduction measures and human escalation

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **MCP Failure**: Manual task assignment with reduced automation
- **Human Bottleneck**: Queue non-essential work, focus on critical tasks
- **Agent Underperformance**: Immediate replacement with backup agents

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Foundation Setup

- Implement HR agent evaluation system and specialist job descriptions
- Create task pattern recognition for agent needs analysis

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Dynamic Creation
- HR-driven specialist agent creation based on task analysis
- Performance tracking system for evaluation cycles
- Context distribution workflows between agents

### Phase 3 (Month 2): Performance Optimization  
- Execute first evaluation cycles with empirical hire/fire decisions
- Optimize specialist job descriptions based on success patterns
- Implement cost-per-task monitoring and ROI tracking

### Phase 4 (Month 3+): Mature Operations

- Enterprise-level fleet optimization with human oversight dashboard

## Open Questions

1. **Context Allocation**: How should we optimize context window usage across multiple active agents?
2. **Agent Retirement**: What is the optimal balance between agent stability and performance improvement?
3. **Specialization Depth**: How specialized should agents become vs. maintaining general capabilities?
4. **Human Override Patterns**: What override patterns indicate systemic issues vs. normal learning curves?

## Success Validation

**Go/No-Go Decision Points:**
- Month 1: ROI ≥ 0% (break-even)
