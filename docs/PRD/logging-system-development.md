## Development Approach

### Parallel Development Strategy

#### **Main Track: Story 1.2 Development**
- Continues as planned with QuickLogger active
- Provides real-world data for logging system testing
- Validates logging performance and reliability

#### **Infrastructure Track: Logging Enhancement**
- **Week 1 Focus**: SQLite analysis engine
- **Week 2 Focus**: Weekly revision automation
- **No blocking dependencies**: Main track continues uninterrupted

### Resource Allocation

| Week | Main Track (Story 1.2) | Infrastructure Track (Logging) | Integration Points |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Story 1.2 Development | SQLite schema + analysis queries | Daily log analysis |
| 2 | Story 1.2 Testing | Weekly revision automation | Story 1.2 vs 1.1 comparison |

### Development Phases

#### **Phase 2: Week 1 Tasks**

**Day 1-2: SQLite Foundation**
- Create universal event schema
- Build JSONL-to-SQLite import pipeline
- Implement basic analysis queries

**Day 3-4: Analysis Engine**
- Build token-efficient query library
- Implement performance analysis
- Create error pattern detection

**Day 5: Story 1.2 Integration**
- Analyze Story 1.2 development patterns
- Compare with Story 1.1 baseline
- Generate first insights report

#### **Phase 3: Week 2 Tasks**

**Day 6-7: Weekly Revision**
- Build automated pattern extraction
- Implement rule generation algorithm
- Create CLAUDE.md update automation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: SQLite performance with large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Index optimization and query batching

- **Risk**: Weekly revision automation complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple pattern detection, evolve gradually

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: Interference with Story 1.2 development
- **Mitigation**: Independent development tracks, shared data only

- **Risk**: Analysis accuracy with limited data
- **Mitigation**: Use Story 1.1 baseline data for validation

### Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: Feature creep in logging system
- **Mitigation**: Strict scope adherence, future enhancements in separate phases

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 3)

### Advanced Analytics
- Machine learning for pattern prediction
- Real-time development coaching
- Predictive error prevention

### Integration Expansion
- Claude Code plugin integration
- Multi-project comparison
- Team collaboration features

### Visualization
- Development dashboard
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Interactive trend analysis

## Approval and Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Approve PRD**: Confirm scope and timeline
2. **Start Phase 2**: Begin SQLite development
3. **Track Progress**: Daily standup integration
4. **Monitor Story 1.2**: Ensure no interference

### Decision Points
- **End of Week 1**: Assess Phase 2 completion, adjust Phase 3 if needed
- **End of Week 2**: Evaluate overall success, plan future enhancements
- **Weekly**: Review Story 1.2 integration, ensure value delivery

This PRD provides the structure for parallel development while ensuring Story 1.2 continues uninterrupted with valuable logging data generation.
