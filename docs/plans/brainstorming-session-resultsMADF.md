1. 48-hour implementation timeline with clear daily goals
2. Technical architecture decisions with pros/cons analysis
3. MCP tool strategy using widely-used, accessible options
4. Fast + Simple approach: no sequential thinking or claude-context initially
5. Hybrid BMAD + MCP-use architecture for optimal flexibility

**Insights Discovered:**
- Shared file system communication optimal for MVP (simple, debuggable, crash-resilient)
- Yahoo Finance, Google News, Reuters provide reliable free/accessible data sources
- Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution provides cost-effective model strategy

**Notable Connections:**
- MCP-use enables dynamic tool access without pre-configuration complexity
