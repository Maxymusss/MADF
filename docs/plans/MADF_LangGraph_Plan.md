# LangGraph Multi-Agent Development Framework - Implementation Plan

### Core Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **LangGraph StateGraph** for workflow orchestration (not Redis)
- **File-based persistence** using JSON (not enterprise databases)
- **Existing Claude Code integration** via `.claude/agents/` configs
- **Task Master bridge** for seamless workflow integration
- **Simple CLI interface** for task submission and monitoring

**Timeline:** 3 weeks (not 30+ weeks)

### Implementation Plan

#### **Week 1: LangGraph Foundation**

**Primary Deliverable:** `madf_langgraph.py`

**Core Components:**
- StateGraph with 4 specialized nodes:
  1. **TaskIntake** - Classifies and routes incoming tasks
  2. **Research** - Uses existing ResearchAgent.json configuration
  3. **Implementation** - Combines PM + development logic
  4. **QualityAssurance** - Final review and validation

**State Management Schema:**
```python
class MADFState(TypedDict):
    task: Dict              # Original task details
    task_type: str          # Classification (frontend/backend/qa/research)
    agent_history: List     # Agent handoff chain
    results: Dict           # Accumulated results from each agent
    confidence_score: float # Overall workflow confidence
    status: str            # Current workflow status
    errors: List           # Error tracking and retry logic
    project_context: Dict  # Project-specific context (alphaseek focus)
    created_at: str        # Timestamps for tracking
    updated_at: str        # Last modification time
```

**Key Features:**
- Task classification based on description keywords
- Agent routing with fallback mechanisms
- Integration with existing `.claude/agents/*.json` configurations
- Claude API calls with specialized prompts per agent
- Confidence scoring and comprehensive error handling
- Agent history tracking for workflow transparency

#### **Week 2: Task Master Integration**

**Primary Deliverable:** `taskmaster_integration.py`

**Integration Points:**
- **Task Queue Monitoring:** Read pending tasks from `.taskmaster/state.json`
- **Format Conversion:** Convert Task Master tasks to MADF-compatible format
- **Status Synchronization:** Update Task Master with workflow progress
- **Results Storage:** Save MADF workflow results back to Task Master
- **Performance Tracking:** Generate metrics and reports

**Bridge Functionality:**
- Identify tasks suitable for MADF processing (implementation, research, QA tasks)
- Execute LangGraph workflow for eligible tasks
- Handle task state transitions (pending → in-progress → completed/review)
- Project context injection (especially alphaseek project focus)
- Error handling and retry logic integration

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
python taskmaster_integration.py list           # Show pending tasks
python taskmaster_integration.py process <id>   # Process specific task
python taskmaster_integration.py process-all    # Process all suitable tasks
python taskmaster_integration.py report         # Performance metrics
```

#### **Week 3: CLI Interface & Real-World Testing**

**Primary Deliverable:** `madf_cli.py`

**User Interface Features:**
- Simple task submission: `python madf_cli.py submit "Implement user authentication"`
- Real-time progress monitoring and status updates
- Agent workflow visualization and debugging
- Integration with existing MCP infrastructure
- Performance dashboards and reporting

**Testing & Validation:**
- **Real alphaseek tasks** from the 80k LOC codebase
- **Performance benchmarking** and optimization
- **Integration validation** with existing CI/CD
- **Error scenario testing** and recovery
- **User workflow validation** end-to-end

### Technical Implementation Details

#### **Agent Node Architecture:**

Each agent node follows this pattern:
1. Load configuration from existing `.claude/agents/*.json`
2. Build specialized prompt based on agent role and task context
3. Make Claude API call with project-specific context
4. Process response and extract actionable results
5. Update workflow state with results and confidence score
6. Handle errors gracefully with retry logic and fallbacks

**Example Agent Integration:**
```python
def research_agent_node(state: MADFState) -> MADFState:
    # Load ResearchAgent.json configuration
    research_config = load_agent_config("researchagent")

    # Build specialized prompt
    prompt = build_agent_prompt(
        config=research_config,
        task=state["task"],
        role="research",
        context=state.get("project_context")
    )

    # Execute Claude API call
    response = claude_model.invoke(prompt)

    # Update state with results
    return update_state_with_results(state, "research", response)
```

#### **Task Master Bridge Pattern:**

The integration maintains loose coupling while providing tight coordination:
- **Non-invasive:** Doesn't modify existing Task Master functionality
- **Event-driven:** Monitors task state changes for processing opportunities
- **Bidirectional:** Updates flow both ways (Task Master ↔ MADF)
- **Recoverable:** Failed workflows reset tasks to pending for retry
- **Auditable:** Full history of MADF processing stored in task metadata

#### **Project Context Integration:**

Special handling for the alphaseek project (primary focus):
```python
alphaseek_context = {
    "project_name": "alphaseek",
    "stage": "growth",
    "loc": "80k",
    "primary_focus": True,
    "agents_assigned": 4,
    "ci_cd_enabled": True,
    "testing_required": True
}
```

- Integration with additional MCP servers
- Web-based dashboard for workflow monitoring
- Advanced task routing and load balancing
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

### Conclusion

This plan delivers the actual stated goal: **LangGraph coordination of Claude Code agents for development workflow automation**, not an overengineered enterprise platform.

The approach is:
- **Pragmatic:** Solves the real problem with appropriate technology
- **Efficient:** 3-week timeline vs 30+ week enterprise build
- **Validated:** Real testing with alphaseek project tasks
- **Sustainable:** Builds on existing infrastructure and patterns
- **Expandable:** Foundation for iterative enhancement based on usage

**Next Step:** Await explicit go-ahead for implementation phase.
