### Layer 2 Agent Types for Diverse Project Development

To expand the 2-layer multi-agent orchestration framework (with Layer 1 fixed as Planning Agent for strategic breakdown/research and Feedback Agent for monitoring/self-improvement), Layer 2 should focus on specialized execution agents. These agents handle tactical implementation, such as coding, testing, deployment, and iteration, while inheriting from the base `ClaudeCodeAgent` template (as outlined previously) to ensure consistency with Claude Code conventions (e.g., tool usage via MCPs, rule injection from `rules/`, and state sharing).

Given the projects you mentioned—**quant research tooling** (e.g., financial modeling, data pipelines, simulations), **client interactive apps** (e.g., web/mobile UIs with real-time interaction), and **open source task tool platforms** (e.g., modular automation hubs like a LangChain-inspired ecosystem for tasks)—I'll suggest a set of modular Layer 2 agent types. These can be composed dynamically in the LangGraph workflow (e.g., via conditional edges or sub-graphs) based on the project type, detected from the planning output.

The architecture emphasizes **modularity and reusability**: Each agent type is specialized but shares tools (e.g., code execution via file I/O, testing libs) and can be parallelized (e.g., using LangGraph's fan-out patterns). For multiple projects, the Supervisor (if reintroduced minimally) or Planning Agent can route to a subset of these agents. Self-improvement flows from Layer 1 Feedback, which analyzes execution traces in LangSmith and updates agent-specific rules (e.g., adding quant-specific constraints like "ensure numerical stability").

#### Key Design Principles for Layer 2 Agents
- **Specialization**: Tailor to domain needs (e.g., quant agents focus on numerical libs like NumPy/SciPy; app agents on frameworks like React/Streamlit).
- **Tool Integration**: Use MCPs for domain tools (e.g., `quant_mcp.json` with backtesting APIs; `app_mcp.json` with deployment hooks).
- **Iteration**: Agents support multi-turn execution (e.g., code → test → refine loop within the agent).
- **Composition**: For a project, chain 2-4 agents (e.g., for quant tooling: Data → Modeling → Validation).
- **Scaling**: Add parallelism (e.g., multiple instances for A/B testing code variants) or hierarchies (sub-agents within Layer 2).
- **Project Mapping**: 
  - Quant Research: Heavy on data/math; agents emphasize accuracy/simulations.
  - Client Apps: Focus on UX/interactivity; agents handle frontend/backend integration.
  - Open Source Platforms: Emphasize modularity/extensibility; agents include contrib/docs tools.

#### Suggested Layer 2 Agent Types
I'll categorize them by project domain, but they can cross-pollinate (e.g., a Testing Agent is useful across all). Each type subclasses `ClaudeCodeAgent`, with custom prompts/rules/MCPs. Implement in `agents/` (e.g., `data_agent.py`).

1. **Data Processing Agent** (Core for Quant Research and Platforms)
   - **Purpose**: Handles data ingestion, cleaning, ETL pipelines. Executes code for loading datasets, feature engineering, and basic stats.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: File I/O, web scraping (e.g., via BeautifulSoup), data libs (Pandas, NumPy). MCP: `data_mcp.json` with schemas for query tools.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Quant: Builds datasets for models (e.g., stock prices via simulated APIs).
     - Apps: Prepares user data for interactive dashboards.
     - Platforms: Ingests task inputs for open-source tools.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Process data per plan: clean, transform, output artifacts like CSV/JSON."
   - **Why Useful**: Foundation for data-heavy projects; can parallelize for big data chunks.

2. **Modeling/Simulation Agent** (Specialized for Quant Research)
   - **Purpose**: Implements algorithms, models, simulations. Executes code for ML/statistical modeling, optimization, or Monte Carlo sims.

     - Platforms: Simulates task workflows for optimization.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Develop model from plan: fit parameters, simulate outcomes, ensure reproducibility."
   - **Why Useful**: Handles compute-intensive tasks; integrates with Feedback for hyperparam tuning via traces.

3. **Frontend/UI Agent** (Core for Client Interactive Apps)
   - **Purpose**: Generates user-facing code (HTML/JS/CSS or frameworks like Streamlit/Dash for Python apps). Executes for rendering prototypes.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: Template engines, UI libs (e.g., if env supports, basic Flask/Streamlit). MCP: `ui_mcp.json` with render/test tools.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Apps: Builds interactive elements (e.g., forms, charts, real-time updates via WebSockets).
     - Quant: Visualizes research outputs (e.g., plotly dashboards).
     - Platforms: Creates user interfaces for task submission.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Code frontend per plan: focus on usability, responsiveness; output deployable scripts."
   - **Why Useful**: Bridges code to user experience; can use image generation hooks if extended.

4. **Backend/API Agent** (Core for Client Apps and Platforms)
   - **Purpose**: Develops server-side logic, APIs, databases. Executes for endpoints, auth, integrations.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: Web frameworks (FastAPI/Flask), DB (SQLite in-memory). MCP: `backend_mcp.json` with API test tools.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Apps: Handles data flow, user sessions.

     - Quant: Integrates with external services (simulated).
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Implement backend: secure, scalable; include error handling from rules."
   - **Why Useful**: Ensures robustness; pairs with Frontend for full-stack apps.

5. **Testing/Validation Agent** (Cross-Cutting for All Projects)
   - **Purpose**: Runs unit/integration tests, validates outputs. Executes code for assertions, coverage.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: Testing libs (Pytest, Unittest). MCP: `testing_mcp.json` with metric calculation.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Quant: Validates models (e.g., statistical tests, backtest accuracy).
     - Apps: UI testing (e.g., simulated interactions).
     - Platforms: Ensures tool compatibility/contributions.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Test artifacts: cover edge cases, report failures for Feedback loop."
   - **Why Useful**: Critical for quality; feeds directly into Layer 1 Feedback for iterations.

6. **Deployment/Integration Agent** (For Apps and Platforms)
   - **Purpose**: Packages, deploys, integrates code (e.g., to Docker, cloud mocks). Executes for build scripts.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: Build tools (setup.py, Dockerfile generation). MCP: `deploy_mcp.json` with version control hooks.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Apps: Deploys to local servers or simulated clouds.

     - Quant: Packages tools as libs.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Deploy per plan: containerize, add CI hooks; ensure portability."
   - **Why Useful**: Completes the dev cycle; handles open-source specifics like licensing.

7. **Documentation/Contribution Agent** (Specialized for Open Source Platforms)
   - **Purpose**: Generates docs, READMEs, contrib guidelines. Executes for Markdown/HTML output.
   - **Tools/MCPs**: Text generation, file I/O. MCP: `docs_mcp.json` with template tools.
   - **Project Fit**:
     - Platforms: Essential for community adoption (e.g., API docs, examples).
     - Apps/Quant: Adds user guides/tutorials.
   - **Example Prompt Snippet**: "Document code: clear, comprehensive; include examples from artifacts."
   - **Why Useful**: Boosts open-source viability; auto-updates via Feedback.

#### Recommended LangGraph Integration
- **Workflow Extension**: In `graph.py`, add nodes for these agents. Use conditional routing based on project type (parsed from Planning output, e.g., if "quant" in plan, route to Data → Modeling → Testing).
  ```python
  # Example addition
  workflow.add_node("data_processing", DataProcessingAgent().invoke)
  workflow.add_node("modeling", ModelingAgent().invoke)
  # ...
  # Dynamic routing function
  def route_layer2(state):
      plan_type = state["artifacts"][-1]["type"]  # e.g., "quant"
      if "quant" in plan_type:
          return "data_processing"
      # etc.
  workflow.add_conditional_edges("planning", route_layer2, {"data_processing": "data_processing", ...})
  workflow.add_edge("data_processing", "modeling")
  workflow.add_edge("modeling", "testing")
  workflow.add_edge("testing", "feedback")
  ```
- **Parallelism**: For efficiency, use LangGraph's `send_to` for concurrent agents (e.g., Frontend and Backend in parallel for apps).
- **Self-Improvement**: Feedback Agent scores each Layer 2 output (e.g., code quality via LangSmith evaluators) and updates domain rules (e.g., append "use vectorized ops for quant speed" to `rules/quant_rules.yaml`).

This set covers your projects while allowing flexibility—start with 3-4 core types and expand. For implementation details, reference LangChain's agent docs or Anthropic's tool-use examples. If you need code snippets for a specific type, let me know!
