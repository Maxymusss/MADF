# BMAD Enhanced Task Management Workflow Design

**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Design Complete

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive design for enhancing BMAD's task management capabilities with intelligent orchestration, predictive analytics, and multi-agent coordination patterns. Provides 3-phase implementation roadmap preserving backward compatibility while adding advanced workflow optimization.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
1. **Agent Specialization Preservation**: Maintain existing agent roles while enhancing coordination
2. **Hierarchical Task Structure**: Epic → Story → Task → Subtask levels
3. **Adaptive Workflow Execution**: Dynamic path selection based on project context
4. **Quality-First Progression**: Mandatory gates prevent progression with unresolved issues
5. **Context-Aware Orchestration**: Intelligent agent selection and task routing

```

### Enhanced Agent Coordination Framework

**1. Task Classification Engine**
- **Complexity Analysis**: Simple, Complex, Critical classification
- **Skill Mapping**: Required capabilities → Available agents
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic QA involvement for high-risk tasks
- **Timeline Estimation**: AI-driven effort estimation with historical data

**2. Dynamic Agent Assignment**
```yaml
agent_assignment:
  primary_criteria:
    - skill_match: 80%
    - availability: current_workload < threshold
    - context_continuity: previous_task_relationship

  escalation_rules:
    - if: complexity == "critical"
      then: require_multiple_agent_review
    - if: dependencies > 3
      then: assign_coordination_agent
    - if: estimated_effort > 4_hours
      then: break_into_subtasks
```

**3. Intelligent Task Orchestration**
- **Parallel Execution Matrix**: Identify independent tasks for simultaneous execution
- **Context Switching Optimization**: Minimize agent context switches
- **Dependency Chain Resolution**: Automatic bottleneck identification and mitigation

## Task Lifecycle States & Transitions

### Core Task States
```yaml
task_lifecycle_states:
  discovery:
    - IDENTIFIED: Initial task recognition from epic/story breakdown
    - ANALYZED: Requirements clarified, complexity assessed
    - PLANNED: Dependencies mapped, agent assigned, timeline estimated

  execution:
    - ASSIGNED: Agent accepted task, work initiated
    - IN_PROGRESS: Active development/implementation
    - BLOCKED: Waiting for dependencies or external input
    - REVIEW_REQUESTED: Work complete, validation requested

  validation:
    - UNDER_REVIEW: QA/peer review in progress
    - REVISION_NEEDED: Issues identified, returned to agent
    - VALIDATED: Quality gates passed

  completion:
    - COMPLETED: Fully done, all criteria met
    - ARCHIVED: Historical record maintained
```

### State Transition Rules

**1. Mandatory Validation Paths**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    IDENTIFIED --> ANALYZED: Requirements gathering
    ANALYZED --> PLANNED: Agent assignment
    PLANNED --> ASSIGNED: Agent acceptance

    ASSIGNED --> IN_PROGRESS: Work starts
    IN_PROGRESS --> BLOCKED: Dependencies missing
    BLOCKED --> IN_PROGRESS: Dependencies resolved

    IN_PROGRESS --> REVIEW_REQUESTED: Work complete
    REVIEW_REQUESTED --> UNDER_REVIEW: QA assigned
    UNDER_REVIEW --> VALIDATED: Quality gates passed
    UNDER_REVIEW --> REVISION_NEEDED: Issues found
    REVISION_NEEDED --> IN_PROGRESS: Agent fixes issues

    VALIDATED --> COMPLETED: Final approval
    COMPLETED --> ARCHIVED: Project closure
```

**2. Quality Gate Integration**
- **Risk Level → Review Requirements**
  - `P0 (Critical)`: Mandatory QA review + peer review
  - `P1 (High)`: QA review required
  - `P2 (Medium)`: Peer review sufficient
  - `P3 (Low)`: Self-validation acceptable

**3. Automatic Transition Triggers**
```yaml
transition_automation:
  IDENTIFIED -> ANALYZED:
    trigger: story_breakdown_complete
    validator: sm_agent

  ANALYZED -> PLANNED:
    trigger: dependencies_mapped
    validator: po_agent

  IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW_REQUESTED:
    trigger: acceptance_criteria_met
    validator: assigned_agent

  UNDER_REVIEW -> VALIDATED:
    trigger: quality_gates_passed
    validator: qa_agent
```

## Task Dependency Management System

### Dependency Type Classification

**1. Hard Dependencies**
```yaml
hard_dependencies:
  blocking:
    description: "Task cannot start until dependency completes"
    examples: ["API design before implementation", "Database schema before queries"]
    enforcement: "Automatic blocking in task queue"

  sequential:
    description: "Tasks must complete in specific order"
    examples: ["Unit tests → Integration tests → E2E tests"]
    enforcement: "Queue ordering with validation"
```

**2. Soft Dependencies**
```yaml
soft_dependencies:
  informational:
    description: "Task benefits from dependency completion but can proceed"
    examples: ["UX wireframes inform but don't block implementation"]
    enforcement: "Warning system, agent decision"

  resource_contention:
    description: "Tasks compete for same agent or system resources"
    examples: ["Two complex tasks assigned to same architect"]
    enforcement: "Load balancing and scheduling optimization"
```

### Dependency Resolution Engine

**1. Cycle Detection & Prevention**
```python
class DependencyManager:
    def detect_cycles(self, task_graph: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        """Detect circular dependencies using DFS"""

    def suggest_cycle_resolution(self, cycle: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Suggest dependency removals or task splitting to break cycles"""

    def validate_dependency_addition(self, from_task: str, to_task: str) -> bool:
        """Prevent addition of dependencies that would create cycles"""
```

**2. Critical Path Analysis**
```mermaid
gantt
    title Task Dependency Critical Path
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Epic 1
    Story 1.1 Foundation    :done,    s1, 2024-01-01, 2024-01-03
    Story 1.2 BMAD Planning :active,  s2, after s1, 3d
    Story 1.3 API Integration :        s3, after s2, 2d
    section Quality Gates
    QA Review Story 1.1     :done,    qa1, after s1, 1d
    QA Review Story 1.2     :         qa2, after s2, 1d
    QA Review Story 1.3     :         qa3, after s3, 1d
```

**3. Dynamic Dependency Resolution**
```yaml
dependency_resolution_strategies:
  parallel_execution:
    when: "No shared resources, independent acceptance criteria"
    action: "Execute tasks simultaneously across available agents"

  dependency_elimination:
    when: "Soft dependency causing bottleneck"
    action: "Promote to informational, proceed with warning"

  task_splitting:
    when: "Large task blocking multiple dependents"
    action: "Break into smaller, independently deliverable subtasks"

  resource_reallocation:
    when: "Resource contention preventing progress"
    action: "Dynamically assign alternative qualified agents"
```

### Intelligent Scheduling Algorithm

**1. Priority Matrix Calculation**
```python
def calculate_task_priority(task: Task) -> float:
    """
    Priority = (Business_Value × Urgency × Dependency_Impact) / Effort
    """
    business_value = task.epic.business_priority  # 1-5
    urgency = calculate_urgency(task.deadline)    # 1-5
    dependency_impact = count_blocking_dependents(task.id)  # 0-N
    effort = task.estimated_hours

    return (business_value * urgency * (1 + dependency_impact)) / effort
```

**2. Agent Allocation Optimization**
```yaml
allocation_strategy:
  expertise_matching:
    weight: 40%
    calculation: "skill_overlap_percentage × agent_expertise_level"

  context_continuity:
    weight: 30%
    calculation: "related_task_history × domain_knowledge_retention"

  workload_balancing:
    weight: 20%
    calculation: "inverse_of_current_workload × agent_capacity"

  deadline_pressure:
    weight: 10%
    calculation: "task_urgency × agent_velocity_on_similar_tasks"
```

## Multi-Agent Task Orchestration Patterns

        2. Current workload
        3. Context continuity
        4. Collaboration history
        """

    def create_agent_team(self, complex_task: Task) -> List[Agent]:
        """
        Form teams for complex tasks requiring multiple expertise
        """

    def handle_agent_unavailability(self, assigned_agent: Agent, task: Task):

        """
        Multi-signal progress detection:
        1. Code commits and file changes
        2. Test coverage improvements
        3. Documentation updates
        4. Acceptance criteria completion
        5. Agent-reported status updates
        """

    def calculate_completion_percentage(self, task: Task) -> float:
        """
        Weighted completion based on:
        - Acceptance criteria met (40%)
        - Code implementation (30%)
        - Test coverage (20%)
        - Documentation (10%)
        """

    def predict_completion_time(self, task: Task) -> datetime:
        """
