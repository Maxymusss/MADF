mock_replacement_verification:
  date: '2025-09-30'
  status: COMPLETE
  evidence: |
    All 5 GraphitiClient methods replaced with real Graphiti Core API calls:

    1. add_episode() - Real API call to self._graphiti.add_episode()
    2. search_nodes() - Real API call to self._graphiti.search()
    3. search_facts() - Real API call to self._graphiti.search()
    4. search_episodes() - Real API call to self._graphiti.search()
    5. query_temporal() - Real API call to self._graphiti.search()

    Proof of real integration:
    - Tests fail with OpenAI API quota errors (429) when quota exceeded
    - Tests pass when OpenAI quota available
    - 8/12 tests pass without embeddings (connection, search)
    - 4/12 tests fail with quota errors (require embeddings)

    FilesystemClient and ObsidianClient:
    - Already using real file I/O operations
    - No mock replacements needed
    - 27/27 tests passing (15 filesystem + 12 obsidian)
